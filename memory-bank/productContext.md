# YourBench Product Context

## Problem Statement
As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there's a growing need for dynamic, domain-specific benchmarks that can evaluate their capabilities on fresh, unseen content. Traditional benchmarks often become outdated or are susceptible to data contamination as models are trained on increasingly larger datasets. YourBench addresses this challenge by providing a framework to generate custom evaluation sets from any domain-specific content.

## User Needs
1. **Researchers** need to evaluate LLMs on domain-specific knowledge without data contamination
2. **Organizations** need to test LLMs on their proprietary or specialized content
3. **Developers** need to understand how well LLMs perform on emerging or niche domains
4. **Educators** need to generate question-answer pairs from educational materials

## Use Cases
1. **Academic Research**: Generate benchmarks from scientific papers to test LLM understanding of recent research
2. **Corporate Evaluation**: Create evaluation sets from company documentation to test LLMs on proprietary knowledge
3. **Educational Assessment**: Develop question-answer pairs from textbooks or course materials
4. **Domain Adaptation**: Test how well LLMs adapt to specialized domains like medicine, law, or engineering

## User Experience Goals
1. **Flexibility**: Users should be able to easily configure the pipeline to suit their specific needs
2. **Transparency**: The process of generating benchmarks should be clear and understandable
3. **Quality Control**: Users should have confidence in the quality of generated questions
4. **Ease of Use**: The tool should be accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise

## Value Proposition
YourBench enables users to:
1. Create custom benchmarks from any text-based content
2. Generate both simple (single-shot) and complex (multi-hop) questions
3. Control the difficulty and style of generated questions
4. Evaluate LLMs on truly zero-shot tasks
5. Maintain up-to-date evaluation sets as domain knowledge evolves

## Competitive Landscape
While there are many static benchmarks available for LLM evaluation, YourBench differentiates itself by:
1. Focusing on dynamic generation rather than static datasets
2. Supporting domain-specific customization
3. Emphasizing zero-shot evaluation to prevent data contamination
4. Providing a complete pipeline from document ingestion to question generation
5. Offering flexibility in model selection for different pipeline stages
