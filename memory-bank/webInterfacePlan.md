# YourBench Web Interface Development Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the development of a web-based interface for YourBench that will allow users to:
1. Configure and run the YourBench pipeline through an intuitive web interface
2. Retrieve generated benchmark datasets from Hugging Face Hub
3. Visualize and explore the results locally in a web browser

## Technical Considerations

### Integration with YourBench

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Web Interface"
        Config[Configuration Builder]
        Runner[Pipeline Runner]
        Results[Results Viewer]
    end
    
    subgraph "YourBench Core"
        Pipeline[Pipeline Handler]
        Stages[Pipeline Stages]
        Utils[Utilities]
    end
    
    Config --> Runner
    Runner --> Pipeline
    Pipeline --> Stages
    Pipeline --> Utils
    Pipeline --> Results
```

- The web interface will use YourBench as a library
- Configuration created in the UI will be converted to YAML format
- Pipeline execution will be wrapped in an asynchronous task
- Progress reporting will be added to the pipeline handler

### Data Flow

```mermaid

    Upload[Document Upload] --> Storage[Local Storage]
    Storage --> Ingestion[Document Ingestion]
    Ingestion --> Pipeline[YourBench Pipeline]
    Pipeline --> Results[Generated Dataset]
    Results --> HFHub[Hugging Face Hub]
    HFHub --> Retrieval[Dataset Retrieval]
    Retrieval --> Visualization[Results Visualization]
```

- Documents uploaded through the UI will be stored locally
- YourBench pipeline will process the documents
- Generated datasets will be stored locally and optionally on HF Hub
- Results can be retrieved from local storage or HF Hub
- Visualization components will render the results in the browser

### Security Considerations

- User authentication for accessing the web interface
- Secure storage of API keys and tokens
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure communication with external services
