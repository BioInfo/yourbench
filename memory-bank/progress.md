# YourBench Progress

## What Works

### Core Pipeline
- ✅ Document ingestion from various formats (PDF, HTML, text)
- ✅ Conversion to standardized markdown format
- ✅ Document summarization using LLMs
- ✅ Intelligent chunking based on semantic similarity
- ✅ Single-shot question generation from individual chunks
- ✅ Multi-hop question generation from multiple chunks
- ✅ Dataset management for intermediate and final results
- ✅ Configuration-driven pipeline customization
- ✅ Unified inference engine for different LLM providers
- ✅ Basic logging and error handling

### Backend API
- ✅ FastAPI application setup
- ✅ Database models and migrations
- ✅ CRUD operations for configurations
- ✅ Document upload endpoints
- ✅ Task management endpoints
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Development environment setup

### Frontend Application
- ✅ React + TypeScript setup with Vite
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling system
- ✅ Layout and navigation structure
- ✅ Configuration builder component
- ✅ Toast notification system
- ✅ Type-safe API client
- ✅ React Query integration
- ✅ Development script for local setup

## What's Left to Build
