# YourBench Progress

## What Works

### Core Pipeline
- ✅ Document ingestion from various formats (PDF, HTML, text)
- ✅ Conversion to standardized markdown format
- ✅ Document summarization using LLMs
- ✅ Intelligent chunking based on semantic similarity
- ✅ Single-shot question generation from individual chunks
- ✅ Multi-hop question generation from multiple chunks
- ✅ Dataset management for intermediate and final results
- ✅ Configuration-driven pipeline customization
- ✅ Unified inference engine for different LLM providers
- ✅ Basic logging and error handling

### User Interface
- ✅ Command-line interface with Typer
- ✅ YAML configuration system
- ✅ Pipeline timing visualization

### Integration
- ✅ Hugging Face Datasets integration
- ✅ Hugging Face Hub upload support
- ✅ Support for multiple LLM providers

## What's Left to Build

### Pipeline Enhancements
- ❌ Deduplication for single-shot questions
- ❌ Deduplication for multi-hop questions
- ❌ Advanced filtering for question quality
- ❌ Parallel processing for improved performance
- ❌ Caching mechanisms to reduce redundant LLM calls

### User Experience
- ❌ Web interface for YourBench (see webInterfacePlan.md)
  - ❌ Interactive configuration builder
  - ❌ Document uploader with drag-and-drop
  - ❌ Real-time pipeline monitoring
  - ❌ Results visualization dashboard
- ❌ Improved error messages and recovery options

### Analysis Tools
- ❌ Question quality metrics
- ❌ Coverage analysis for source documents
- ❌ Difficulty distribution visualization
- ❌ Model performance comparison

### Documentation
- ❌ Comprehensive user guide
- ❌ API documentation
- ❌ Example notebooks
- ❌ Best practices guide

## Current Status
YourBench is currently in alpha stage, with a functional core pipeline that can generate questions from source documents. The basic functionality is working, but there are still several enhancements needed for a production-ready system.

### Key Milestones Achieved
1. ✅ Basic pipeline implementation
2. ✅ Configuration system
3. ✅ Document ingestion and processing
4. ✅ Question generation (single-shot and multi-hop)
5. ✅ Dataset management

### Upcoming Milestones
1. ❌ Deduplication and quality filtering
2. ❌ Advanced analysis tools
3. ❌ Web interface implementation (14-week plan)
4. ❌ Comprehensive documentation
5. ❌ Beta release

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. Performance bottlenecks with large document sets
2. Limited error recovery for failed pipeline stages
3. Dependency on external LLM providers
4. Memory usage with large datasets

### Quality Issues
1. Inconsistent question quality depending on source material
2. Occasional irrelevant questions from noisy document sections
3. Varying difficulty levels not always matching user preferences
4. Multi-hop questions sometimes not requiring true integration

### User Experience Issues
1. Complex configuration requirements for new users (to be addressed by the web interface)
2. Limited feedback during long-running pipeline stages (to be addressed by real-time monitoring)
3. Command-line interface may be challenging for non-technical users (to be addressed by the web interface)
4. Lack of visualization tools for analyzing results (to be addressed by the results visualization dashboard)
