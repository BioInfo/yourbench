Ubisoft has updated its financial targets for FY2024-25, expecting net bookings of around €1.95bn and break-even non-IFRS operating income and free cash flow. The company also revised its second quarter net bookings target to €350-370m. Key updates include the delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows to 14 February 2025, with no traditional Season Pass and a Day 1 release on Steam, and plans to improve the player experience for Star Wars Outlaws, which will be available on Steam on November 21. CEO Yves Guillemot emphasized a player-centric approach and announced a review to improve execution and accelerate strategic growth.
