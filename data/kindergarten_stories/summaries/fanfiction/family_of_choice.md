Kassandra, the granddaughter of Leonidas, struggles to find her place in Sparta despite being ethnically Spartan. She feels uncomfortable with her mother Myrrine's attempts to mold her into a traditional Spartan woman and resents her lack of understanding of Kassandra's desires and strengths. In contrast, Kassandra values her relationships with her brother Alexios and her friends, particularly Barnabas, who trusts and accepts her for who she is. Ultimately, Kassandra decides to leave Sparta to maintain her independence and freedom, feeling happier and more at peace with her decision. Her departure is a testament to her refusal to be bound by societal expectations and her desire to forge her own path.
