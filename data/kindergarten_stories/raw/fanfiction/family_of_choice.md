# Family of Choice

Laconia was as foreign to Kassandra as the populous harbour of Athens, or the lambent glare of the buildings in Olympia's central avenue. Perhaps the trees were familiar, and Kassandra thought that she recognised the slip designs used on the glazed pots left about their old house, but everything else about Sparta felt uncomfortably foreign.

Kassandra knew that she was supposed to feel comfortable here. In Sparta, and this street specifically. Everywhere she went in Greece, she had been identified as ethnically Spartan, and she had her family now. She could be proud of it again.

She wasn't.

She understood her own history, her own value to these people now. Since the moment of her birth, the granddaughter of Leonidas had been the ultimate prize for any Spartan son: a direct line to the Agiad throne. Every good mother, every father, wanted to see their blood on the throne, so they had all individually made exceptions to the normal rules of child-raising to ensure that they had Kassandra and Myrrine's personal favour.

Nikolaos might have done her a mercy by throwing her to her death instead of letting her reach puberty in that snake pit.

Kassandra's heart ached for Markos in a manner that made no sense. She had never had any illusions about what he was, not since their first interaction. Theirs had been a transactional relationship, and any pretense of love was not even attempted manipulation; it had been more a shared joke than anything else over the years.

Markos had provided for Kassandra when no-one else had, and for all the citizens of Kephallonia were eager to speak badly of him to his child-runner, none of them had ever offered to love and support her in his place.

Also, none of them had ever expressed surprise that she stayed as his kept misthios rather than striking out on her own. There had been something tying Kassandra to the old man, even if she was slow to see it. And somehow, it felt stronger in retrospect than her bond to her own mother, who she still hadn't told she killed her father.

Unlike Kassandra, who still longed for Kephallonia's silence, Alexios took to Sparta like a duck to water. On the surface, he was the perfect laconic man: strong, powerful, and utterly uninterested in overthrowing the current governance to assume power himself. Alexios's personality spun more goodwill for their family with everry furtively wonder-filled glance than Kassandra managed completing a half-dozen highly dangeros bounties. Myrrine's indulgence of Alexios's newfound desire to own beautiful items with the profits of the port of Naxos didn't hurt how much Spartans liked him either, Kassandra added a little cynically.

No, that wasn't fair. Kassandra did not begrudge her little brother or mother for that.

Kassandra had everything she needed. She didn't need or want her mother's gifts. She had lived frugally for years, first by necessity and then by choice, and was not particularly interested in owning luxuries for the sake of it. Kassandra only really ever felt the need to spend her money refitting the Adrestia again or convincing Hephaistos to work on improving her equipment. Both were costly endeavours in their own right, and neither of these services could be found in the city even if she had wanted to contribute to the Spartan economy.

Alexios, on the other hand, enjoyed such gifts and experiences. He, more than anyone, deserved to be spoiled and to be happy. Even if the source of his happiness was something that Kassandra could not share.

Kassandra was used to being disappointed by reality, and had become an expert at accepting it and moving on.

Kassandra had come to understand even her birth father's motivations more over the years. She still didn't regret killing him, and she certainly didn't forgive him, but she accepted them. And when she had been offered the chance to bring him back to life by the simulation of Persephone—for Myrrine's sake, if nothing else—she had been shocked by how much she wanted it to be real. Nikolaos had been a victim of the Cult of Kosmos just like Myrrine and the Oracle of Delphi, after all.

She might be an abomination in the eyes of the gods, but didn't Kassandra's family deserve a miracle by now?

Pythagoras's story had been pretty and heartfelt, but Kassandra trusted his interpretation of the truth no more than she trusted that spoken by her mother.

Myrrine was a beautiful, flawed woman. Kassandra had idolised her while on Kephallonia after their separation because her mother had stood up to everyone on the behalf of Alexios and Kassandra, but her bitterness towards the father did not mean that Kassandra couldn't see the problematic parts of Myrrine's behaviour now.

Pythagoras could be no different.

Kassandra had killed Nikolaos for what he had agreed to do to Alexios, and her supposed biological father had been afforded even less consideration. He had abandoned her more thoroughly that Nikolaos, who had loved her and accepted her punishment for his behaviour.

No, even in hindsight Kassandra firmly believed she had been correct to strike Pythagoras down without remorse.

That act of violence had definitely not been her wanderlust talking.

Unlike the disappointing Pythagoras, Myrrine was everything that Kassandra had wanted, and exactly like she remembered.

That was why it took so long for Kassandra to admit to herself that she resented the way her mother appeared so unchanged by what had happened in their lives. That she could mother Alexius as if Chrysis had never stolen him, and lecture Kassandra on her duty as if they hadn't both lived outside of Sparta for longer than they had lived inside.

Perhaps she would never have admitted it, if Barnabas had not asked.

But how could she deny Barnabas?

Even Herodotus had wanted things from her, even if it was only to be part of, and to record, the the story of Leonidas' descendant. Kassandra had initially feared he was an agent of the Cult because of this. Barnabas, on the other hand—she smiled unwillingly—had been found raving about cyclops to the worst possible audience, and had promptly signed over his entire ship to her service once she saved him.

He asked for nothing, so she gave everything. The best crew, the best armaments, and the most precious thing Kassandra could give him—freedom, his and hers.

For Barnabas's smile, she had slain a great beast of the Isu so that she could bring him back its head and prove his grandest tale true. Kassandra had even stayed her hand and let his daughter work on a farm away from Kassandra's protection rather than burn down the granaries and force her back into their loving arms.

Barnabas thought of her as a great hero of old, and Kassandra secretly believed that her desire to not prove him wrong was the only reason that Sparta still stood.

She was trying to be happy, for him. Well, him and Alexios.

Alexios trusted her because, well, she had already proved that she could have killed him, abused him, used him, if she had wanted to. Barnabas had trusted her with everything: his life, his daughter, his crew.

Myrrine... didn't.

Myrrine, like Pythagoras, seemed determined to ignore Kassandra's strength and desires to impress upon her a particular vision of their future.

Myrrine wasn't like the mother Kassandra remembered. She seemed to realise that Kassandra needed more reasons to stay in Sparta than just her family's presence, but everything she suggested just made Kassandra more eager to summon Barnabas and run away. Myrrine believed that the greatest protection for her daughter could have was to be bound more publicly to Sparta. As if that would stop them fearing her. Or perhaps—Kassandra thought cynically—it was supposed to make Kassandra remember that she was supposed to be one of them herself.

Kassandra was no Spartan, no matter what he looks implied, and to stay in Sparta would be to allow herself to be treated as one of them. She would not be a trophy wife so that they could say that the royal line was reunited with the blood of Leonidas.

Yet if she stayed in Sparta then that was what Myrrine—and everyone else around them—would push Kassandra to be. As if nothing had changed since they were children.

It always seemed to come down to that, nowadays.

And Kassandra refused to deal with that.

She refused to feel guilty about that uncompromising refusal, either.

So she wrote Alexios a note, stopped by the market to find some gifts for Barnabas and her Odessa, and she left.

It was the happiest she had been in months.
