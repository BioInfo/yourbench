# Ubisoft updates its financial targets for FY2024-25

Paris, September 25, 2024 – Following a meeting of its Board of Directors, Ubisoft updates
its financial targets for FY2024-25. The Company now expects net bookings of around
€1.95bn, and around break-even non-IFRS operating income and free cash flow. The
company now targets FY2024-25 Net bookings for the second quarter FY2024-25 to stand at
around €350-370m million. The revised targets are mainly a reflection of decisions taken for
Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws.
Listening to players' feedback, and as an illustration of our player-centric approach, the
following important decisions relative to Assassin’s Creed Shadows have been taken:
- Assassin’s Creed Shadows will now be released on 14 February 2025. While the game
is feature complete, the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide
additional time to further polish the title. This will enable the biggest entry in the
franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual
protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay
styles.

- We are departing from the traditional Season Pass model. All players will be able to
enjoy the game at the same time on February 14 and those who preorder the game
will be granted the first expansion for free.
- The game will mark the return of our new releases on Steam Day 1.

Additionally, despite solid ratings (Metacritic 76) and user scores across the First Party and
Epic stores (3.9/5) that reflect an immersive and authentic Star Wars universe, Star Wars
Outlaws initial sales proved softer than expected. In response to player feedback, Ubisoft’s
development teams are currently fully mobilized to swiftly implement a series of updates to
polish and improve the player experience in order to engage a large audience during the
holiday season to position Star Wars Outlaws as a strong long-term performer. The game will
be available on Steam on November 21.

Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, said “Our second quarter
performance fell short of our expectations, prompting us to address this swiftly and firmly,
with an even greater focus on a player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering
commitment to the long-term value of our brands.

Although the tangible benefits of the Company’s transformation are taking longer than
anticipated to materialize, we keep on our strategy, focusing on two key verticals – Open
World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences – with the objective to drive growth,
recurrence and robust free cash flow generation in our business.

In the light of recent challenges, we acknowledge the need for greater efficiency while
delighting players. As a result, beyond the first important short-term actions undertaken, the
Executive Committee, under the supervision of the Board of Directors, is launching a review
aimed at further improving our execution, notably in this player-centric approach, and
accelerating our strategic path towards a higher performing model to the benefit of our
stakeholders and shareholders.

Finally, let me address some of the polarized comments around Ubisoft lately. I want to
reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest
possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to
creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy.”

Further details will be provided during Ubisoft H1 results announcement on October 30, 2024.
