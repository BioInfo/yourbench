1

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

FLYRCADO is indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) under rest or stress
(pharmacologic or exercise) in adult patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) to evaluate for
myocardial ischemia and infarction.
2

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1
Radiation Safety – Drug Handling
Handle FLYRCADO with appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure [see Warnings and Precautions
(5.2)]. Use waterproof gloves and effective shielding, including lead-glass syringe shields, when handling and
administering FLYRCADO.
Radioactive drugs should be used by or under the control of healthcare providers who are qualified by specific training and
experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides, and whose experience and training have been approved by the
appropriate governmental agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides.
2.2
Recommended Dosage, Preparation, and Administration Instructions
Recommended Dosage
• The recommended activity for each type of examination is presented in Table 1.
• Administer two doses by intravenous injection, one for rest imaging and one for stress imaging, using
either pharmacologic or exercise stress, in either a 1-day or 2-day protocol.
• If performing a combined exercise/pharmacologic stress protocol, administer the recommended activity
for pharmacologic stress.
• When rest and stress imaging are performed on the same day, the recommended minimum stress activity is 2fold the rest activity for pharmacologic stress and 3-fold the rest activity for exercise stress to provide adequate
image quality and obscure residual signal from the first acquisition.
• The recommended maximum total volume administered in one day is 6.1 mL.

Patient Preparation
Instruct patients to drink water to ensure adequate hydration prior to administration of FLYRCADO and to continue
drinking and voiding frequently during the first hours following administration to reduce radiation exposure [see
Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Drug Preparation
• Use aseptic technique and radiation shielding to withdraw and administer FLYRCADO.
• Calculate the necessary volume to administer based on calibration time and activity using a suitably calibrated
instrument.

Reference ID: 5454049

•
•
•
•
•
•

Visually inspect FLYRCADO for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration and do not use if
either is observed.
Ensure the correct syringe is used and has adequate volume (at least 1 mL to 2 mL) so that the activity in the
syringe can be administered without excessive dead volume loss.
Measure patient dose using a dose calibrator immediately before administration.
Do not use and discard FLYRCADO 8 hours after end of synthesis or when the activity falls below the activity
requirement at the time of injection, whichever is earlier.
FLYRCADO may be diluted aseptically with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Diluted product should be used
within 8 hours after end of synthesis or when the activity falls below the activity requirement at the time of
injection, whichever is earlier.
Dispose of unused product in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable regulations.

Administration Instructions
• Administer FLYRCADO via intravenous injection as a bolus lasting less than 10 seconds and immediately
follow with a flush of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
• The minimum time between rest and stress dose administration is:
o 30 minutes when using pharmacologic stress
o 60 minutes when using exercise stress
• When using pharmacologic stress, administer FLYRCADO at the time of peak vasodilation according to the
prescribing information for the stress agent, using an intravenous port different from the one used for the
stress agent.
• When using exercise stress, administer FLYRCADO after the patient reaches at least 85% of their agepredicted maximum heart rate or exhibits ischemic signs or symptoms. The patient should then continue to
exercise for approximately 1 minute to 2 minutes after the injection. If the patient cannot achieve the target
heart rate, the examination may be converted to pharmacologic stress.
2.3
Image Acquisition Instructions
For rest and stress imaging, image reconstruction should include attenuation correction.
Rest Imaging
Begin the PET acquisition 5 minutes after FLYRCADO administration and acquire images for 10 minutes using a scanner
in 3D mode.
Pharmacologic Stress Imaging
Begin the PET acquisition 5 minutes after FLYRCADO administration and acquire images for 10 minutes using a scanner
in 3D mode.
Optionally, dynamic imaging may be performed, starting immediately prior to the injection of FLYRCADO.
Exercise Stress Imaging
Once the patient has been positioned on the scanner and respiration has begun to return to normal, begin image
acquisition (about 15 minutes to 25 minutes after administration of FLYRCADO). Acquire images for 10 minutes using a
scanner in 3D mode.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1
Risks Associated with Exercise or Pharmacologic Stress
Patients evaluated with exercise or pharmacologic stress may experience serious adverse reactions such as myocardial
infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction, stroke, and seizure. Perform stress testing in the setting
where cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff are readily available. When pharmacologic stress is selected as
an alternative to exercise, perform the procedure in accordance with the pharmacologic stress agent’s prescribing
information.
5.2
Radiation Risks
FLYRCADO contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation
exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to patients
and health care providers [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]. Advise patients to hydrate before and after
administration and to void frequently after administration.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:
• Risks Associated with Exercise or Pharmacologic Stress [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
6.1
Clinical Trials Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical
trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates
observed in clinical practice.
The safety of FLYRCADO was evaluated in 1,600 subjects in clinical studies, including 1,575 (98%) subjects with known or
suspected coronary artery disease and 25 (2%) healthy subjects. All 1,600 subjects were dosed under rest conditions,
with a mean dose of 102 MBq (2.8 mCi) FLYRCADO. A total of 1,568 (98%) subjects were also dosed under stress
(exercise or pharmacologic) conditions, with a mean activity of 252 MBq (6.8 mCi) FLYRCADO by intravenous route. The
demographic characteristics of the study population were 31% female, mean age 62 years (range 19 years to 90 years),
81% White, 11% Black or African American, 1% Asian, and 7% other or unreported race, and 10% Hispanic or Latino, 81%
Not Hispanic or Latino, and 9% unreported ethnicity.
Stress testing procedures are associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Adverse
reactions occurring in ≥2% subjects receiving FLYRCADO during PET MPI under rest and stress (pharmacologic or
exercise) are presented in Table 3.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1

Pregnancy

Risk Summary
There are no data on use of flurpiridaz F 18 in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth
defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.
All radiopharmaceuticals, including FLYRCADO, have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of
development and the magnitude of the radiation dose. If considering FLYRCADO administration to a pregnant woman,
inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from flurpiridaz F
18 and the gestational timing of exposure.
FLYRCADO contains ethanol (a maximum daily dose of 337 mg anhydrous ethanol). The lower limit of safety for ethanol
use during pregnancy has not been established. Published studies have demonstrated that ethanol is associated with
fetal harm including central nervous system abnormalities, behavioral disorders, and impaired intellectual development.
If considering FLYRCADO administration to a pregnant woman, inform the patient about the potential for adverse
pregnancy outcomes associated with ethanol exposure during pregnancy.
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies
have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated
background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%,
respectively.

Reference ID: 5454049

8.2

Lactation

Risk Summary
There are no data on the presence of flurpiridaz F 18 or its metabolites in human milk or animal milk, the effects on the
breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Based on clinical guidelines, exposure of FLYRCADO to a breastfed
infant can be minimized by advising a lactating woman to temporarily discontinue breastfeeding and to pump and
discard breast milk for a minimum of 8 hours after administration of FLYRCADO. The developmental and health benefits
of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for FLYRCADO and any potential adverse
effects on the breastfed child from FLYRCADO or from the underlying maternal condition.
8.4
Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness of FLYRCADO in pediatric patients have not been established.
8.5
Geriatric Use
Of 1,600 subjects in clinical studies of FLYRCADO, 720 (45%) were 65 years of age and over and 181 (11%) were 75 years
of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of FLYRCADO have been observed between patients 65
years of age and older and younger adult patients.

DESCRIPTION

11.1 Chemical Characteristics
FLYRCADO (flurpiridaz F 18) injection is a radioactive diagnostic drug for intravenous use. The molecular formula of
flurpiridaz F 18 is C18H22Cl18FN2O3, the molecular mass is 367.8, and the structural formula is:

Y:(o
/ i I

0 ~1aF

Chemically, flurpiridaz F 18 is 2-tert-butyl-4-chloro-5-[[4-(2-(18F)fluoranylethoxymethyl)phenyl]methoxy]pyridazin-3-one.
FLYRCADO is a sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, clear, colorless to yellow radioactive solution. Each mL
contains 190 MBq to 2,050 MBq (5 mCi to 55 mCi) of flurpiridaz F 18 at end of synthesis, up to 2.3 mcg flurpiridaz, and
the following inactive ingredients: 45 mg hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (as a solubilizer and co-radiostabilizer), 35 mg L(+)-ascorbic acid (as a radiostabilizer), 8.2 mg sodium hydroxide, and 55.2 mg anhydrous ethanol, in water for injection.
The pH of the solution is between 5.5 and 8.
11.2 Physical Characteristics
Fluorine-18 decays by positron (β+) emission and has a half-life of 109.8 minutes. The principal photons useful for
diagnostic imaging are the 511 keV gamma photons, resulting from the interaction of the emitted positron with an
electron. Principal emission data for fluorine-18 are shown in Table 4.

The point source air-kerma rate constant for fluorine-18 is 3.74E-17 Gy m2/(Bq s); this coefficient was formerly
defined as the specific gamma-ray constant of 5.7 R/hr/mCi at 1 cm. The first half-value thickness of lead (Pb) for
fluorine-18 gamma rays is approximately 6 mm. The relative reduction of radiation emitted by fluorine-18 that
results from various thicknesses of lead shielding is shown in Table 5. The use of about 8 cm of Pb will decrease the
radiation transmission (i.e., exposure) by a factor of about 10,000.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1

Mechanism of Action

Flurpiridaz F 18 is an analog of the mitochondrial complex 1 (MC-1) inhibitor, pyridaben. Flurpiridaz F 18 is extracted by
the myocardium proportional to the blood flow and binds to heart tissue that has biologically active mitochondria.
Therefore, radioactivity in viable myocardium is higher than in infarcted tissue.
12.2

Pharmacodynamics

The relationship between flurpiridaz F 18 plasma concentrations and successful imaging was not explored in clinical
trials.
12.3

Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of flurpiridaz F 18 were evaluated in healthy subjects. Blood radioactivity peaked at
2.3 minutes with blood clearance followed by a rise and plateau at around 3% of the 296 MBq (8 mCi) flurpiridaz F
18 intravenous dose until 7 hours post administration. The fluorine-18 radioactivity in blood during the first 15minutes post administration was associated with flurpiridaz while it was associated with flurpiridaz metabolites
thereafter.
Distribution
Flurpiridaz F 18 distributes to the liver (19% of injected activity), kidneys (9%), brain (8%), and heart wall (3%) about
10 minutes post-dose. The heart wall radioactivity was retained for 1 hour after administration.
Elimination
Flurpiridaz F 18 and its metabolites were cleared from blood within 48 hours.
Metabolism
Flurpiridaz F 18 was shown to undergo biotransformation to numerous polar metabolites.

Reference ID: 5454049

Excretion
Following intravenous administration of a single dose of 3H-radiolabeled flurpiridaz, 63% of the administered dose
was recovered in urine (0% unchanged flurpiridaz) and 30% in feces (0% unchanged flurpiridaz).
Specific Populations
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of flurpiridaz F 18 were observed for age, sex, body
mass index, diabetic status, mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A), or renal impairment (eGFR ≥19 to 89 mL/min).
The effect of moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B and C) or end stage renal disease on flurpiridaz
F 18 pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated.
13

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis
No carcinogenicity studies of flurpiridaz have been conducted.
Mutagenesis
Flurpiridaz did not demonstrate mutagenic potential in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), in an in
vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, or in an in vivo rat micronucleus assay.
14

CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies
The safety and effectiveness of FLYRCADO were evaluated in two prospective, multicenter, open-label clinical studies in
adults with either suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) (Study 1: NCT03354273) or known or suspected CAD (Study
2: NCT01347710).
Subjects received two injections of FLYRCADO: one at rest and one during stress [see Dosage and Administration (2.2,
2.3)]. For the FLYRCADO stress injection, subjects received either a pharmacologic stress agent or engaged in exercise
stress. PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) was performed at both rest and stress using cardiac gating and low-dose
CT attenuation correction. Subjects also received rest and stress SPECT MPI using technetium Tc 99m sestamibi or
technetium Tc 99m tetrofosmin on a different day from the PET MPI. The stress modality was to be the same for PET
and SPECT.
Stress and rest images were displayed side-by-side for the assessment of perfusion and wall motion abnormalities. Three
qualified readers, blinded to clinical data, performed independent assessment of each subject’s rest and stress images,
with each recording an overall qualitative diagnosis of normal, ischemia, ischemia plus scar, or scar. For analyses of
sensitivity and specificity, normal was considered image negative and all other diagnoses were considered image
positive.
14.2 Suspected Coronary Artery Disease
Study 1 evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of FLYRCADO PET MPI for the detection of significant CAD in subjects
with suspected CAD who were scheduled for invasive coronary angiography (ICA).
A total of 578 subjects were evaluable for effectiveness, having rest and stress imaging and evaluable truth standard
data. Subjects ranged in age from 26 years to 88 years, with a mean age of 64 years. A total of 188 (33%) were female,
and 473 (82%) were White, 35 (6%) were Black or African American, 6 (1%) were Asian, and 64 (11%) were other races
or not reported. In addition, 79 subjects (14%) reported Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Pharmacologic stress was performed
in 83% of subjects and exercise stress in 17% of subjects.

Reference ID: 5454049

The sensitivity and specificity of FLYRCADO PET MPI for detection of significant CAD, defined as the presence of
significant stenosis in at least one major epicardial coronary artery or major branch by quantitative coronary
angiography (QCA) are reported in Table 6. Results for both ≥50% stenosis and a secondary analysis using ≥70% stenosis
as the threshold for significant CAD are shown.

*Includes 12 subjects who had reference standard images categorized as uninterpretable by the central reader but were forced to be diagnosed as positive or
negative (2 subjects as positive and 10 subjects as negative).

From a blinded re-evaluation of 60 randomly selected PET MPI images presented during the main reading sessions,
intra-reader kappa ranged from 0.71 to 0.93 for the three readers.
Using a 50% stenosis threshold, sensitivity of SPECT MPI was 61% to 76% for the three readers, with the lower bound of
the 95% confidence intervals ranging from 55% to 70%, and specificity of SPECT MPI was 51% to 65%, with the lower
bound of the 95% confidence intervals ranging from 46% to 60%.
14.3 Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease
Study 2 evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of FLYRCADO PET MPI for the detection of significant CAD in subjects
with known or suspected CAD who had ICA without intervention within 60 days prior to imaging or were scheduled for
ICA.
A total of 755 subjects were evaluable for effectiveness, having rest and stress imaging for FLYRCADO PET and evaluable
truth standard data. Subjects ranged in age from 36 years to 90 years, with a mean age of 63 years. A total of 235 (31%)
were female, and 619 (82%) were White, 101 (13%) were Black or African American, 8 (1%) were Asian, and 24 (4%)
were other races or not reported. Pharmacologic stress was performed in 71% of subjects and exercise stress in 29% of
subjects.
The sensitivity and specificity of FLYRCADO PET MPI for the detection of significant CAD, defined as the presence of
significant stenosis in at least one major epicardial coronary artery or major branch by QCA or as history of myocardial
infarction are reported in Table 7. Results for both ≥50% stenosis and a secondary analysis using a threshold of ≥70%
stenosis for significant CAD are shown.

From a blinded re-evaluation of a randomly selected 10% of PET MPI images presented during the main reading
sessions, intra-reader agreement ranged from 90% to 95% for the three readers.
Using a 50% stenosis threshold, sensitivity of SPECT MPI was 43% to 58% for the three readers, with the lower bound of
the 95% confidence intervals ranging from 38% to 53%, and specificity for SPECT MPI was 80% to 92%, with the lower
bound of the 95% confidence intervals ranging from 76% to 89%.

PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Adequate Hydration
Instruct patients to drink water to ensure adequate hydration prior to administration of FLYRCADO and to continue
drinking and voiding frequently during the first hours following administration to reduce radiation exposure [see
Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Pregnancy
Inform pregnant women of the risks of fetal exposure to radiation dose if they undergo a radionuclide procedure and
the potential risk of exposure to ethanol which is present in FLYRCADO [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Lactation
Advise a lactating woman to temporarily discontinue breastfeeding and to pump and discard breast milk for at least 8
hours after FLYRCADO administration to minimize radiation exposure to a breastfed infant [see Use in Specific
Populations (8.2)].
