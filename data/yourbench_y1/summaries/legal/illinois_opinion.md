The Illinois Supreme Court reversed lower court rulings that dismissed a grand jury indictment against Daniel Basile III for criminal sexual assault. The lower courts found the indictment invalid due to a detective's possibly misleading testimony that implied Basile confessed to the assault when he had only admitted to having sex with the victim. The Supreme Court determined the testimony was not unequivocally misleading and that sufficient evidence existed for the indictment regardless of the detective's statement. A dissenting opinion argued the testimony was misleading and prejudiced, warranting the indictment's dismissal.
