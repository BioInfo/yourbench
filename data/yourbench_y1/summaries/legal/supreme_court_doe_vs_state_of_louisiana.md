The Supreme Court denied the Department of Education's request to partially stay preliminary injunctions against a new Title IX rule that expands the definition of sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity. While all justices agreed that injunctions were warranted on three specific provisions, including the expanded definition, the majority found those provisions were not readily severable from the rest of the rule, thus leaving the broader injunctions in place. Justice Sotomayor, joined by three other justices, dissented in part, arguing the injunctions should be limited to only the three challenged provisions as the remainder of the rule is unrelated to the states' specific claims and causes unnecessary harm by preventing its implementation.
