The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Zackey Rahimi that individuals subject to domestic violence restraining orders, including a finding of a credible threat to another person's safety, can be prohibited from possessing firearms. The Court found that this law aligns with the nation's historical tradition of disarming individuals who pose a threat to others, citing the existence of surety and "going armed" laws.  Multiple justices, including Sotomayor, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett, and Jackson, filed concurring opinions highlighting various aspects of the historical analysis and the application of Bruen's framework. Justice Thomas dissented, arguing that historical laws do not provide a comparable burden or justification for the federal statute.
