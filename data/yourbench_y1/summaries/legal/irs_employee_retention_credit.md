The IRS is accelerating its efforts to process Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claims, focusing on both preventing improper payments and ensuring legitimate businesses receive their due payments.  They are taking actions such as sending disallowance letters for potentially invalid claims, intensifying audits, and pursuing criminal investigations related to fraud.  Simultaneously, the IRS has identified a group of low-risk claims and is expediting their processing and payment. The agency is also working with the tax professional community to address complexities and concerns surrounding the ERC program, while acknowledging and addressing potential errors in the disallowance process.
