Governor JB Pritzker granted nearly $8 million to combat food deserts in Illinois, with Carlinville and Urbana receiving significant funding. Carlinville will use the money to establish a new grocery store, while Urbana's Common Good Food Co-op will upgrade its equipment.  These grants, part of a larger $20 million initiative, aim to improve access to healthy food and boost local economies in underserved communities. The initiative addresses the issue of over 3 million Illinois residents living in food deserts, highlighting the importance of grocery stores in community well-being.
