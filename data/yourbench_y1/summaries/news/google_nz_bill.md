Google has threatened to remove links to New Zealand news from its search results and other products if the country passes the Fair Digital News Bargaining Bill, which would require tech companies to pay publishers for content.  Google argues the bill is flawed and would have negative consequences, while the local media industry supports it and accuses Google of attempting to bully the government.  The bill is currently under review, and the situation mirrors a similar conflict in Canada that resulted in Google agreeing to compensate Canadian publishers. The New Zealand government is still consulting with all stakeholders before making a final decision.
