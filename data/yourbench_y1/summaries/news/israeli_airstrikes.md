The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated with Israel conducting airstrikes in Beirut and closing a main border crossing into Syria, while Hezbollah launched rockets into Israel. The Israeli military claims to have killed numerous Hezbollah fighters and targeted their intelligence headquarters.  The violence has displaced thousands of people and prompted a warning from Iran about stronger retaliation if attacked by Israel. This escalation is directly related to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which began with a Hamas attack and has resulted in a devastating war in Gaza.
