The increasing use of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software by ride-hailing drivers is raising safety concerns, highlighted by a recent accident in Las Vegas. While drivers utilize FSD to reduce fatigue and increase earnings, the technology has limitations and operates in a regulatory gray area, unlike heavily regulated robotaxi services. Experts and some drivers express reservations about FSD's safety for ride-hailing,  pointing to its shortcomings and the lack of oversight from both ride-hailing companies and regulatory bodies. Despite the risks, some drivers envision a future where Tesla's network enables fully autonomous ride-hailing.
