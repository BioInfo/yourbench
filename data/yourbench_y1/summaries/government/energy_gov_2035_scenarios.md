Chapter 3 of the National Transmission Planning Study examines the role of transmission in achieving a 90% decarbonization target by 2035 in the contiguous US.  Analyzing three scenarios with varying levels of transmission expansion, the study finds that increased interregional transmission, particularly using HVDC technology, offers significant benefits for integrating renewable energy resources and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. However, realizing these benefits necessitates large-scale transmission buildout and careful coordination of interregional power exchanges.  Operational analysis highlights the importance of flexibility in generation resources and the potential for regions with high renewable penetration to become major exporters.  The study emphasizes the need for further research on HVDC dispatch strategies, interregional coordination, and other technical and operational challenges associated with large-scale transmission expansion.
