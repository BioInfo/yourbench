The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is opening a new international field office in Quito, Ecuador on September 10, 2023, to expand its capacity to process refugees, particularly from the Americas.  Located within the U.S. Embassy, the office will support the resettlement of refugees, facilitate family reunification, and provide information on various lawful pathways to the U.S.  It will also handle tasks such as fingerprinting, DNA collection, and fraud detection. This will be USCIS's 12th international field office and services will be available by appointment only.
