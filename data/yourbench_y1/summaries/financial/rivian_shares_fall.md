Rivian's stock fell after the company announced a lower-than-expected Q3 2024 vehicle delivery figure (10,018) and slashed its 2024 production forecast from 57,000 to 47,000-49,000 vehicles. The production cut is attributed to a shortage of a component used in Rivian's in-house motors. Despite this, the company maintains its 2024 delivery outlook of low single-digit growth compared to 2023. Rivian's stock has struggled in 2024, down 56% year-to-date, amid slower-than-anticipated EV demand and concerns about the company's cash burn.
