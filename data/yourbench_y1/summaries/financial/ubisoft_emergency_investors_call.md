Ubisoft has revised its FY2024-25 financial targets downwards due to the underperformance of Star Wars Outlaws and a decision to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows to February 14, 2025, for further refinement.  Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch on Steam on day one and will forgo the traditional season pass model. Despite positive reviews, Star Wars Outlaws saw softer than anticipated sales, prompting Ubisoft to focus on implementing updates to improve the player experience.  Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reaffirmed the company's commitment to a player-centric approach and creating games for a wide audience, while also announcing a review to improve execution and accelerate their strategic path towards a more efficient and high-performing model.
