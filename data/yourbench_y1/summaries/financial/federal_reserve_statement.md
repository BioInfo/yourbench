The Federal Reserve's FOMC announced that it will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. While the economy continues to grow and inflation is easing, the Fed aims to ensure that inflation sustainably moves toward its 2 percent objective before considering rate cuts.  The Committee will continue its policy of reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt/MBS and remains prepared to adjust its stance if risks to its goals emerge.  The announcement also details specific decisions regarding interest rates and open market operations to implement the policy.
