The document investigates methods for improving the reliability of LLM-based dialogue state tracking (DST) in task-oriented dialogue systems by estimating confidence scores. It explores various approaches suitable for both open- and closed-weight LLMs, including softmax probabilities, raw token scores, and verbalized confidence estimations.  The study finds that fine-tuning open-weight LLMs like Llama3 improves both DST accuracy and confidence score calibration.  Furthermore, combining multiple confidence estimation methods, especially with open-weight models, leads to the most reliable DST performance and well-calibrated confidence scores, as evident from improved AUC and ECE metrics. The research suggests that incorporating confidence estimation and self-probing strategies can significantly enhance the reliability and accuracy of LLM-based dialogue systems.
