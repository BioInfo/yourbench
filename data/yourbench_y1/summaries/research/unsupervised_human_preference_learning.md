The paper introduces a novel approach to personalize large language models (LLMs) by leveraging small "preference agent" models that generate natural language rules to guide a larger pre-trained LLM. This method addresses the challenge of personalizing LLMs with limited user data by training the agent to encode user preferences into rules, derived from the difference between the LLM's zero-shot output and the desired output. Experiments demonstrate significant improvement over existing personalization methods across diverse datasets, validated by both automated and human evaluation.  The proposed approach offers a cost-effective and flexible solution for building highly personalized LLM applications without the need for resource-intensive fine-tuning of the large model.
