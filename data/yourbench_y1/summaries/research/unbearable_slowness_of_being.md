The article explores the paradox of slow human behavior, which operates at a maximum rate of approximately 10 bits per second, compared to the much higher information processing capacity of the human nervous system, including sensory organs and individual neurons. This slow rate is consistently observed across various tasks and is significantly lower than the theoretical capacity of the brain. The authors discuss potential explanations for this discrepancy, including serial processing constraints and the evolutionary history of the brain being optimized for navigation, while also challenging alternative explanations such as photographic memory and unconscious processing. They highlight the implications of this slow cognitive rate for fields like brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence, and propose research directions focusing on the contrast between the fast, high-dimensional processing of the "outer brain" and the slow, low-dimensional processing of the "inner brain" responsible for decision-making and behavior.
