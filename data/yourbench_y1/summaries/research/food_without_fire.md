This study investigated the impact of solar cook stoves on household meal preparation and fuel consumption in rural Zambia using a randomized controlled trial. While solar stove adoption was high (40% of dishes), the study found no significant effects on dietary diversity or cooking frequency. However, there were significant reductions in firewood consumption, time spent collecting firewood, and overall fuel costs. These findings suggest that while solar stoves may not change dietary patterns in the short-term, they can help reduce reliance on biomass fuels and offer economic benefits to households. Further research may be needed to explore the long-term impacts of solar stoves on nutrition and to identify complementary interventions that could promote dietary diversification alongside fuel-efficient cooking technologies.
