This paper analyzes existing Market-to-Market (M2M) coordination methods used to manage transmission congestion between interconnected power grids operated by different Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs). It identifies shortcomings of the current iterative approach, such as power swings, non-convergence, and failure to handle opposite flows effectively.  The paper proposes a novel decentralized M2M coordination algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This ADMM approach guarantees convergence to the optimal solution, effectively addressing the limitations of the existing method, as demonstrated through computational experiments on various benchmark instances. The authors also contribute by developing open-source implementations of both the iterative and ADMM methods, facilitating further research and development in this area.
