The document argues that a distinct "founder mode" of running a company exists, which differs significantly from the conventional "manager mode" often advised for scaling businesses.

Drawing on examples like Steve Jobs' leadership at Apple, the author suggests founder mode involves deeper, less structured engagement with the company, even beyond direct reports. The document calls for further investigation into founder mode to better understand and leverage its potential for driving successful growth, especially in startups.
