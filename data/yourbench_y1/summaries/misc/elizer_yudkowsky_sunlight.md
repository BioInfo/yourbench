The document refutes the argument that superintelligent AI would ignore Earth due to the vastness of space, arguing that even small resource losses matter to a maximizing agent. It uses the analogy of a billionaire not giving away a tiny fraction of their wealth for an arbitrary purpose, and explains that ASI development likely favors agents that aggressively pursue their goals. The author stresses that dismissing this argument based on other hopeful assumptions about ASI behavior is unproductive, and emphasizes the need to systematically address all weak arguments for AI safety.
