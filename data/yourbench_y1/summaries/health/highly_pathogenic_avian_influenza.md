The FDA and USDA are working to ensure the safety of the commercial milk supply during the outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in dairy cattle.  Studies have confirmed that pasteurization effectively eliminates the H5N1 virus in milk, making commercially available pasteurized milk and milk products safe for consumption.  The FDA continues to advise against raw milk consumption due to potential risks. Ongoing research and surveillance efforts aim to further validate pasteurization's efficacy, understand the prevalence of H5N1 in milk, and explore interventions like genome-edited chickens resistant to the virus. Multiple retail sample surveys have shown no viable H5N1 in commercially available dairy products.
