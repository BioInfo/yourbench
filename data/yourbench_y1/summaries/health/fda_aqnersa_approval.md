Aqnersa (levacetylleucine) is an oral suspension indicated for the treatment of neurological symptoms of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) in adults and children weighing 15 kg or more.  Dosage is determined by body weight and is administered up to three times daily, with or without food.  Aqnersa may cause harm to a developing fetus, so females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception.  Common side effects include abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, upper respiratory tract infections and vomiting.  Aqnersa should not be taken with N-acetyl-DL-leucine or N-acetyl-D-leucine, and patients should be monitored for adverse reactions if used with P-gp transporter substrates.
