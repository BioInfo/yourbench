Flycardo (flurpiridaz F 18) is a radioactive diagnostic agent used in positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging to assess myocardial ischemia and infarction in adults with known or suspected coronary artery disease. It is administered intravenously with dosage dependent on whether rest and stress imaging are performed on the same day or over two days. While there are no contraindications, warnings include the risks associated with exercise or pharmacologic stress testing and radiation exposure. The most common adverse reactions are dyspnea, headache, angina pectoris, and chest pain.
