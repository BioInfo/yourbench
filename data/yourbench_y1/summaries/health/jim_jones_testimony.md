Jim Jones, Deputy Commissioner for Human Foods at the FDA, testified before the House Subcommittee on Health regarding the new Human Foods Program (HFP) and its strategic priorities of enhancing food safety and nutrition. The HFP, launching October 1, 2024, aims to prevent foodborne illnesses, strengthen oversight of food chemical safety, and reduce diet-related chronic diseases through initiatives like sodium reduction targets and updated "healthy" food labels.  Jones highlighted progress in areas like infant formula safety and managing chemical contaminants, while acknowledging challenges including resource limitations and the need for stronger authorities to address the evolving food landscape. He emphasized the importance of collaboration with stakeholders and increased transparency to bolster public trust and achieve the FDA's public health mission.
