Air pollution poses a significant threat to children's health worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, causing a range of severe health issues and even death. Children's developing bodies and brains make them uniquely vulnerable to the damaging effects of air pollution from sources like household fuels, traffic, waste burning, industry, wildfires, sand and dust storms, and secondhand smoke.  The report advocates for immediate action by governments, caregivers, the health sector, the private sector, and civil society to reduce exposure to these pollutants through policy changes, cleaner technologies, and community engagement. It also emphasizes the importance of empowering children and young people to become advocates for clean air and environmental justice.
