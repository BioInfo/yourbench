Herbicide Damage

We are getting plant samples from lawns,
greenhouses, and cold frames with herbicide
damage. Many growers do not realize how
sensitive growing plants are to herbicides.
Some herbicides such as glyphosate (Roundup)
can drift over long distances to affect tender
plants. Roundup, however, does not have any
soil activity. Note that in tomato, Roundup
causes bleaching at the base of leaflets. This
sign of Roundup damage also occurs in
dogwood. In wheat, Roundup causes
shortened flags, severe leaf twisting, stuck in
the boot, and bleached interveinal areas. Other
classes of herbicides such as the phenoxy
herbicides (2-4-D), also kill by direct contact, but
have a long residual in soil. Severely affected
plants will not grow, flower, or fruit properly even
if they survive the initial exposure. Symptoms
are leaf curling, twisting, chlorosis, strapping,
and stunting.

Apple

A common genetic disorder of apple is known
as Burrknot. It causes differentiated root tissue
to grow above the soil line. Rough, raised gall-
like structures appear on the trunk and/or
branches usually at the nodes. These galls
superficially resemble Crown gall but are not
caused by a disease organism. High
temperatures, low light, and high humidity can
stimulate development of these above ground
root initials. A few of these growths cause little
problems, but severe Burrknot can cause trees
to become stunted, girdled, or weakened at the
site of the Burrknot. The galls are also a magnet
for borer attacks. Some rootstocks are more
susceptible to Burrknot than others. Burrknot is
common on M7, M9, M26, MM111, and Mark
rootstocks. Scion cultivars such as Gala,
Empire, and Springdale are also susceptible.
The optimal solution is to plant rootstocks that
are not genetically disposed to Burrknot
formation. The knots can be removed by
surgically cutting them out, or sometimes by
painting them with Gallex.
