Performance testing of planter downward force under different soil conditions at the UA Maricopa Agricultural Center
A Cottoninc funded project for 2019 season

Experimental work carried out on wet soil on the flat using a with 4-row John Deere MaxEmerge-5 without soil firming
hardware. Speed of operation and seed depth settings were held constant

A) Two soil types:
a. Sandy Loam (Field 3)
b. Sandy Clay Loam (Field 4)
B) Three soil strength conditions of top 3 inches at time of planting:
a. Field 3: 60, 100, 175 psi
b. Field 4: 45, 31, 80 psi
C) Four additional downward force levels (0, 110, 220, 330 Ib)
