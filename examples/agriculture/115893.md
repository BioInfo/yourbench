The use of pesticides may be associated with

Even More Insects Than We Feared Have Disappeared in The
Last Decade

“The drivers of arthropod decline (...) in grasslands
(...) are associated with the proportion of agricultural
land in the landscape"

Biodiversity conservation is one of the large issues
that govern our science nowadays. Insects are
species that must be protected because they are a
primary food source for several species in the world,
and provide significant ecosystem services, such as,
pollination, biological control and decomposition.

However, the survival of these important organisms
might be at risk. Research indicates a potential
decline in insects’ population. There is a lot of
uncertainty regarding the factors leading to this
potential decline. However, one factor that has been
frequently pointed out is insect’s habitat loss due to
land use for agriculture and urbanization.

Sustainability

“We know that we need to
make cotton more
sustainable, and its

something that we as a
company can't do
ourselves.”

* Michael Kobori, VP, Sustainability, Levi
Strauss & Co.

Over the last years, consumers have become
more aware of agricultural practices that
might affect organisms and the environment.
Thus, consumers along with industry have
demanded sustainable practices in agriculture
and other areas. Sustainability has become a
key factor in the purchasing decisions of
several consumers and industries in the
world. Being able to produce cotton following
sustainable practices will become even more
important to be competitive, for access to
different markets and to attend to the need
for more sustainable practices.

How does biological control
help to achieve some of these
demands?

+ Conserve biodiversity
+ Reduced insecticide use and toxicity

+ Sustainability

One of the goals of this presentation is to
discuss with you how conservation biological
control practiced in Arizona cotton has helped
to achieve some of the demands for
sustainability in agriculture within the
context of pest management. I will explain
how it has helped to conserve biodiversity in
crop systems where insecticides are
deployed; reduce number of sprays through
the use of insecticides safer to natural
enemies and other non-target organisms; and
how it has enabled social, economic and
environmental sustainability in cotton
production.

Selectivity of insecticides towards natural
enemies

We can classify insecticides based on their safety or
selectivity towards natural enemies and other non-
target organisms. In our system, insecticides that
conserve the majority of natural enemies are called
"fully selective”. Insecticides that harm some
natural enemies, but yet conserve the majority of
them are called “partially selective”. However,
insecticides that kill almost any insect are called
“broad-spectrum insecticides”. “Fully” and
"Partially” selective insecticides are compatible with
conservation biological control, because natural
enemies are conserved after their application.
However, broad-spectrum insecticides kill natural
enemies. As a result, pest resurgence and secondary
pest outbreaks may take place because pests are
released from biological control.

Conservation biological control can be
achieved through the use of selective
insecticides, which are safer towards natural

services. The compatibility of new cotton
insecticides with natural enemy conservation
is the key factor to avoiding pest problems in
our highly developed cotton Integrated Pest

Control

How do selective insecticides work in concert
with biological control?

Selective insecticides reduce pest density
while conserving natural enemies. This
process allows natural enemies to outweigh
pests, resulting in a functioning biological
control of pests.

These arthropods are key predators that dominate
the relationship between whiteflies and their
predation in the Arizona cotton. They include:

A small empidid fly that feeds exclusively on whitefly
adults (not eggs or nymphs) and other insects.

Collops beetle.

Big-eyed bugs.

Lacewings (only green lacewing larvae feed on
whiteflies. The adult is a non-feeding life stage).

June July August September

This chart shows the number of large whitefly nymphs
per disk over time. Dashed grey line = large nymph
threshold. A selective insecticide (green arrow) was
sprayed once large nymphs were above threshold. When
the insecticide was sprayed, there were lots of whiteflies,
however, there was not a proportional number of
predators to provide functioning biological control (left
scale). The chemical residual lasts only for a few days
(red rectangle). However, once this residual is gone,
whiteflies remain below threshold, because the use of a
selective insecticide favored biological control, reducing
whitefly numbers while conserving natural enemies. As a
result, natural enemies finally outweighed whitefly
numbers & were able to provide functioning biological
control (right scale). The period when pest control is
exclusive due to natural enemies & other natural factors,
after the application of a selective insecticide, is called
Bioresidual.

To determine the selectivity of insecticides to

Insecticides were sprayed every 14 days for a
total of 3 sprays at their highest labeled
rates. Candidate insecticides were compared
to a positive control (a broad-spectrum
insecticide), and a negative control, the
untreated check (UTC). We created a worse-
case scenario by using the highest rates and
applying 3 sprays at biweekly intervals. We
sampled pests and non-target organisms (i.e.,
natural enemies), and we identified and
counted more than 30 taxon.

I would like to explain how to interpret PRC.
The green curve is the untreated check (y =

untreated check. Generally, insecticide curves
above or that overlap the UTC curve are safe
to a given arthropod community. However,
curves below the untreated check might
indicate that an arthropod community is
being affected by an insecticide.

These charts are called principal response

The charts above display PRC during two
growing seasons in Maricopa, AZ, where
insecticides were sprayed three times
(arrows). PRCs are accompanied by a species

weight the more the response for that species

Predator : prey ratio

When we think about biological control
mathematically, it is ratio between the number of
natural enemies to the number of prey. There is a
specific proportion between predator and prey that
results in functioning biological control.

Bordini, Pier & Ellsworth 22

Selective Insecticides,
Predators & Risk

2020 Field Crops
Clinics, January

Less prey > less predators

Because biological control is a proportion, it means
that when there are more whiteflies, more
predators can be supported.

Bordini, Pier & Ellsworth 23

However, when there are fewer whiteflies, fewer
predators can be supported. Then, probably PQZ
and Exirel are not harming predators. The reduction
in the arthropod community in these insecticides is
likely due to a reduction in prey availability,
because they provided an excellent whitefly
control.

The broad-spectrum insecticide compromised

densities in this treatment (acephate does
not kill whiteflies in our system). The UTC had
lower ratios often times because while
natural enemies were unaffected (no spray),
whitefly populations continued to grow more
than in the insecticide treatments where
whitefly efficacy is good (lowering whitefly

The demand for more sustainable and

might seem like a recent demand, however,
this demand has been noticed by the
scientific community for about 60 years.

Arizona has made use of sustainable and
ecologically-based practices through the

RISK

Substituting current agricultural practices
with more sustainable, ecologically-based
practices and reducing pesticide usage is a
noble goal. However when making a decision
to change a practice, these decisions cannot
be made in a vacuum and should not be made
willy-nilly without thought. Many times
changes in behavior are made in the hopes of
a more favorable outcome (that can be
greater well-being, more money, healthier
environment, etc.). Ultimately behavior
changes are made in the face of avoiding or
mitigating risks.

distilled down to three influences: hazard, exposure,
and vulnerability. If any of these components are
missing (are zero), then there will be no risk.

These three factors are present in our daily lives. A
hazard can be a casino, online shopping, food, etc. Our
vulnerability can be how we are feeling at the moment,
how hungry one is, how bored one is, the possibilities
are endless. If we don’t have exposure to these
hazards we have no risk, we are safe. If we aren't ata
casino, we aren't at risk of using a slot machine, if we
don’t have access to the internet, we can’t online shop.

Today we will be focusing on toxicological risk as it

potentially kill an individual. Not everything
sprayed in this industry has the same
hazards. Some are considered to be “hotter”
than others (those that are broad-spectrum
and less selective).

Vulnerabilii

Vulnerability includes factors that affect your
sensitivity to a product. When the EPA
reviews pesticides they need to think of not
only an average population, but the most
sensitive populations. There are mitigation
programs that only apply to very specific
populations based on their unique
vulnerabilities.

Toxiologie (Reson = noe]

Exposure

Exposure is the other component of risk. It is
the frequency, duration, and route of contact
with the hazard. If you have no exposure, the
product of these three components will be
zero and there will be no risk. If you don’t
swim in the ocean you are not likely to ever
get killed by a shark.

Vulnerability

High Risk

Low Risk

Risk is the color across the chart. High risk is
the red zone, low risk is the green zone, and if
you are at middle risk you are in the yellow
zone. Vulnerability can shift the color across
the diagonal gradient depending on the
population. A more tolerant population will be
depicted with more green (less risk) than a
more vulnerable population.

As exposure increases you are increasing the

Risk of Harm

A chemical has a specific hazard, which is more or
less toxic depending on the vulnerability of the
population.

The exposure might be the same, but depending on
the vulnerability of the population, the hazard may
be more or less toxic. Notice how the hazard relates
to the vulnerability. With the same hazard there is
more vulnerability and greater risk to the population
represented in the right hand chart. However, at this
point exposure is at zero. What does that mean for
both? It means that there is no risk to either
population. As stated earlier, if a factor is missing or
at zero, there is no risk in that particular situation.

Adult Child

For the same chemical (same hazard) and
same exposure, the child will be more at risk
than the adult (note the underlying color for
both points on the charts). The adult is much
more tolerant. This fact must be kept in mind
when you are treating around areas with

Bringing it back to our current discussions,
we have our targets (the pest we want to get
rid of) and the non-targets, which in this case
are our beneficials we are looking to conserve
to possibly delay sprays against whiteflies.

Destruction of Natural Enemies

'DP103282F

3 sprays} 8/24/11

This image is an excellent example of risk. In this
situation we are looking at the beneficials and
chemistries used to control a primary pest. Among
the plots, the targets and non-targets were exposed
to selective chemistries, broad spectrum chemistries
and no chemistries. As a result, the risk level varied
across the field from no risk to high risk. The center
plot shows a high risk scenario where a broad
spectrum was used, which killed the beneficials in
the process of killing the pests. This caused an
outbreak of secondary pests (mites). A low risk
scenario is where the selective chemistries were
sprayed and a no risk scenario (where the hazard
was missing) is present in the untreated check
(UTC). No secondary outbreak of mites occurred in
these places.

Selective Insecticides,

Taking a look at the selectivity table you have
just been shown. This table is much more
than a handy chart to show you what
chemistries are the best for a specific target
or the chemistries that pose the lowest risk to
the natural enemies in your fields.

‘Stuff that poses)

You have seen this table previously. Taking
another look at it from a risk vantage point,
fully selective chemistries pose a low risk,
partially selective pose a moderate risk,
broad-spectrum pose a high risk. This is all
very intuitive and applies to not only
beneficials, but in most cases, to other non-
targets as well.

Take a look at the right side of the table. This
shows the risk to other non-targets (including
humans) and something we have not
discussed today, the risk of whiteflies
developing resistance. As can be expected,
those chemistries that are highly selective
and safe for natural enemies, are relatively
low risk for other non-targets.

As you look farther down on the chart to the red zone, the
broad spectrums, the risk to other non-targets become
important. Those that are not safe to beneficials also tend
to be less safe for other non-targets. However, do notice
that with some products that are not safe to beneficials,
there is low risk to other non-targets (i.e. inhalation risk).

What risk factor is missing from this chart? Economics. At
times, economic risk is the overriding decision factor (and
that is okay!). It’s not all about cost or selectivity, it isa
combination of a multitude of factors, including those
listed on this chart. When making spray decisions, many
factors will be considered, some more than others
depending on the situation. It is important to weigh all
your options (and risks associated with these options)
before making a control decision that best fits the current
need.
