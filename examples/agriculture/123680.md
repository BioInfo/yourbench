Cherry and Plum

Black knot of cherry and plum is a serious
disease throughout the United States. The
fungus affects fruit spurs, twigs, and branches.
Infection typically occurs on the newest growth.
Abnormal growth of bark and wood tissues
produces small, light-brown swellings that
eventually rupture as they enlarge. In late
spring, the rapidly growing young knots have a
soft texture that becomes covered with a
velvety, olive-green growth of the fungus. In
summer, the young knots turn darker and
elongate. By fall, they become hard, brittle,
rough and black. During the following growing
season, the knots enlarge and gradually
encircle the twig or branch. The cylindrical or
spindle-shaped knots may vary from one-half
inch to a foot or more in length and up to 2
inches in diameter. Girdling by the gall causes
death of the twig or branch. Small twigs often
die the first season they become infected. The
most important control measure is pruning out
the infected twigs and destroying them,
removing wild plums and cherries from adjacent
fence rows, and fungicides applied from bud
break to early summer.

Maple

Maple anthracnose is a common. fungal
infection in years with cool wet conditions at the
time new leaves are emerging in the spring.
Anthracnose is usually most noticeable in the
bottom leaves of the tree but may become
widespread in favorable weather. Black lesions
on or next to the veins are diagnostic and there
is often leaf curl and distortion of the newest
leaves. Severe infection can result in extensive
leaf drop. Healthy trees will put on new leaves
by early summer and are not seriously
threatened by this disease. Therefore, the best
control for anthracnose is to maintain good tree
health. Trees suffering from anthracnose
should be fertilized in the spring and kept well-
watered throughout the season to reduce
stress. Sanitation also is very important in
minimizing infection the following year. This is
because the fungus over-winters within fallen
leaves and twigs. In the spring, splashing rain
carries the spores to newly emerging leaves and
the infection cycle starts over. All fallen leaves
and twigs should therefore be raked up and
destroyed. Fungicide applications may be
made to trees with a history of severe defoliation
early in the spring when buds first begin to open
(MP154) although this may be difficult
depending on the size of the tree. Fungicides
containingg copper or chlorothalonil are
effective. Spraying is of no benefit once the tree
has leafed out and is showing symptoms.

Rust on ornamentals

Herbaceous ornamentals have been coming
into the clinic with rust. Hollyhocks are a
favorite cottage garden plant that is prone to
hollyhock rust. Hollyhock rust rarely kills the
plant, but severe infections cause yellowing
and early leaf-fall. The fungus attacks all green
parts of the plant in the early spring or autumn.
The disease first appears as lemon-yellow to
orange pustules on the underside of the lowest
leaves. The pustules resemble small blisters
that turn reddish-brown with age. The rust can
spread quickly to stems and other leaves.

Another common rust seen in the spring is jack-
in-the- pulpit rust. It attacks the underside of
the leaves causing yellowing and early leaf
drop. Control of both types of rust involves
removing infected leaves and destroying them
at the first sign of infection. When plants are
finished blooming flower stalks should be cut
down and destroyed. Good sanitation is

necessary as rust spores over-winter on the
ground in plant debris. Fungicides listed for
ornamentals give good control if applied early as
a protectant, however you should always read
and follow label directions to make sure the
product is approved for use on a particular
ornamental plant and especially read all caution

Slime Molds

¢

Southern Plant Diagnostic Network

Issue 4-May 14, 2006

During the spring and summer, we_ get
numerous reports about a "nasty" substance
growing in spots in the yard (photo).
Sometimes these spots are jelly-like, but later
turn dry and powdery on the blades of the
grass. Often, they are bluish gray or similar
colors, but may be orange, yellow or other
colors as well. They may erupt overnight and
are especially common in wetter areas or after
extensive periods of rain or overhead irrigation.
These patches are formed by slime molds, a
microscopic organism that feeds on bacteria
and swarms around looking for them in grass
and decaying organic matter. Once the swarm
of slime mold cells have eaten enough bacteria,
they congregate into many small "slugs" which
crawl up onto grass blades and form a stalk
with spores on top (closeup photo). The spores
are then spread around by splashing water,
wind or mechanical movement (mowers,
walking). Slime molds are a natural part of the
environment and are not harmful. If unsightly,
you can simply wash them away with a garden
hose.

WHEAT SOOTY MOLD

We are seeing the first evidence of sooty mold
on wheat heads that have been prematurely
killed by spring freeze injury, barley yellow dwarf
and other conditions. When a wheat tiller is
prematurely killed by "whatever" in the spring,
the carbohydrates that should have gone into
the grain become available to various fungi that
naturally live on the surface of the plant. These
"saprophytic" fungi grow rapidly on the killed
heads, consuming the unused carbohydrates
and most of these fungi produce abundant, dark
spores — thus the term sooty mold (photo).

There is no recommended control since these
fungi do not affect living, healthy wheat.

Fire Blight

Fire blight is a common and destructive
bacterial disease of pome fruit trees and related
plants. Pears are extremely susceptible, but
apples, quince, crabapple and pyracantha are
also attacked. Infections can destroy limbs and
in severe cases the entire tree or shrub. The
disease appears in the spring as soon as the
plant begins active growth. A light tan bacterial
ooze seeps from twig and branch cankers
formed by infection the previous season.
Bacteria from these previous cankers are
moved by insects, rain, etc. to flowers which
become infected. As the infection moves into
and down the stem, they turn black and wilt,
forming a "shepherd's" crook. Blackened
leaves and stems cling to branches the rest of

the season unless carefully pruned out.
Pruning is the most important control measure
and diseased branches should be cut 10-12”
below visible signs of disease, carefully carried
away from susceptible trees and destroyed.
Pruners should be dipped in 10% bleach
between each cut to prevent spreading the
infections further. Trees with a history of fire
blight can be sprayed the following spring at bud
break with streptomycin (Ag Strep, Ag
Streptomycin, etc. or oxytetracycline
(Mycoshield) to attempt to prevent or reduce the
disease — however success may vary greatly
depending on the susceptibility of the tree, the
weather, spray coverage and timing. Copper
fungicides have been reported to have some
effect, but you should read all warnings and
cautions on these products before trying.
Remember to read and follow all label directions
before use.

Tomato Early Blight

We are starting to receive samples of tomato
with early leaf symptoms of early blight, caused
by the fungus Alternaria solani. This is a very
destructive disease of tomatoes each year in
Arkansas and will cause many of the leaves to
drop as well as spots on stems and fruit at
times. Many commonly grown tomato varieties
are susceptible to the disease, so fungicides
(MP154) and crop rotation may be your only
option. You must catch the disease early and
keep the fungicide on all leaves consistently to
do the best job of control. Lesions of early
blight on leaves form characteristic "target
spots" and may be surrounded by yellow
regions as the infection develops.
