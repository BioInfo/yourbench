PERMIT GUIDANCE

1) Importation, interstate movement, and environmental release of the listed regulated organisms that
have been genetically engineered may require a different permit issued under regulations at 7 CFR
part 340. Any unauthorized importation, interstate movement, or environmental release (including
accidental release) of a regulated GE organism would be a violation of those regulations. Before
moving genetically engineered organisms, contact APHIS Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS)
at: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/biotechnology. If BRS does not require a permit,
contact the Pest, Pathogen, and Biocontrol permit unit for further guidance at: pest.permits@usda.gov
2) If an animal pathogen is identified in your shipment, to ensure appropriate safeguarding, please refer
to http:/\www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/animals/animal_import/animal_imports_an
products.shtml

3) If a human pathogen is identified, please refer to the CDC Etiologic Agent Import Permit Program
at http://www.cdc.gov/od/eaipp/

4) This permit DOES NOT fulfill the requirements of other federal or state regulatory authorities.
Please contact the appropriate agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the APHIS Veterinary Services unit, the APHIS Biotechnology Regulatory Services, or
your State's Department of Agriculture to ensure proper permitting.

5) If you are considering renewal of this permit, an application should be submitted at least 90 days
prior to the expiration date of this permit to ensure continued coverage. Permits requiring containment
facilities may take a longer period of time to process.

6) When the regulated material includes Domestic soil

You must abide by all local quarantines see: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/

maintenance of these regulated materials/organisms. This requirement includes but is not
necessarily limited to: packaging directly exposed to the regulated materials/organisms, substrates
(culture media, soil, plant materials (food materials or host plants)), leftover/unused/unneeded live
cultures, and dead specimens/cultures unless specified otherwise in the permit.

Prior to disposal or reuse, you must treat all contaminated and all potentially contaminated
materials by one of the following methods, either alone or in combination:

1) autoclaved (see protocol below), 2) disposed of off-site by a facility holding a valid PPQ
compliance agreement (organisms and/or contaminated waste must be stored in sealed containers
prior to pick up by this company), 3) incinerated, 4) immersed in a minimum of a final
concentration of 0.525 percent sodium hypochlorite (for example; 1 part fresh household bleach to
9 parts water) for at least 20 minutes, or 5) immersed in 70 percent alcohol for at least 30 minutes.
Treated waste will be double bagged prior to disposal.

Other sterilization methods are only allowed with prior written agreement from the USDA/APHIS
PPQ Pest Permit Staff.

If using an autoclave the following protocol must be used:

a. Waste must be autoclaved at 121 Celsius (250 Fahrenheit) for a minimum of 30 minutes at 15
psi.

b. Autoclave tape or other indicators must be placed on each load prior to treatment. The autoclave
tape or other indicator on each container must be checked to verify color change before disposal.
c. The autoclave must be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions annually and a
commercially available biological indicator kit that uses bacterial spores of Geobacillus
stearothermophilus that are rendered unviable at 121 Celsius (250 Fahrenheit) must be used every
three months.

OR

The autoclave must be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions every two years and
a commercially available biological indicator kit that uses bacterial spores of Geobacillus
stearothermophilus that are rendered unviable at 121 Celsius (250 Fahrenheit) must be used every
two weeks.

d. A written record of the calibration and the biological indicator tests must be maintained.

You must follow the manufacturer's instructions for the Geobacillus sterothermophilus and if any
growth is observed, you must have the autoclave serviced and retested before it is used again for
the regulated articles/organisms listed on this permit.
