Corn

Corn Smut, caused by the fungus Ustilago
maydis, can produce startling symptoms, but is
generally not considered a serious pathogen.
Annual loses seldom exceed 2% where
resistant cultivars are grown. Although all
above-ground parts of the plant can be infected,
Corn smut is most spectacular when kernels are
infected. Large galls form instead of normal
kernels when the fungus invades the kernels
and starts growing. Galls begins as glistening
silvery white to greenish white, but eventually
darkens and becomes a mass of powdery, dark
olive brown to black spores. The incidence of
smut is higher on nitrogen rich soils, or recently
manured soils. Resistant varieties are the best
method of control. Infected plant parts should be
removed before they can sporulate. In some
parts of the world infected ears are considered
a delicacy while the galls are in the fresh soft
stage. It is sold fresh or canned as huitlacoche,
cuitlacoche, or maize mushroom.

Corn Crazy Top

Corn Crazy Top of corn, causal agent
Sclerophthora macrospora, is widespread in the
United States. This disease is one of the several
downy mildews that attack corn and sorghum.
Symptoms depend on the time of infection and
degree of colonization by the pathogen.
Excessive tillering (six to ten tillers per plant),
rolling, and twisting of the upper leaves, and
leafy proliferation of the tassel are common
symptoms. Leaves may be narrow, straplike,
leathery, chlorotic, and stunted. The oospores
are 45-75um in diameter, hyaline to yellow,
globose, with granular contents. Sporangia are
lemon shaped 30-65 x 60-100, attached to
short, simple sporangiophores emerging from
stomata. Crazy top is a problem when soils have
been flooded shortly after planting or before
plants are in the four to five leaf stage. Water
trapped in the whorl of small plants can also lead

to infection. Soil or leaf saturation for 24-48
hours is enough for infection to occur. There
are no chemical controls for Crazy top. Good
soil drainage is the only preventative.

Corn Rust

Two types of corn rust infect corn in Arkansas.
Common Corn Rust caused by Puccinia sorghi
is seen nearly every year but doesn’t usually
cause serious yield loss. Common Rust
development requires relatively cool
temperatures (54 to 82 degrees F) and nearly
100% relative humidity for about six hours.
Young leaf tissue is more susceptible to
infection than emerged leaves. After tasseling,
leaves should be relatively immune to further
common rust development. Common Rust has
cinnamon-brown colored round to elongated
pustules that frequently form in bands on the
lower part of the leaf. Common Rust pustules
form on both upper and lower sides of an
individual leaf, distinguishing Common from
Southern Rust, which predominately sporulates
on the upper leaf surface. Unlike Common Rust,

bey

Issue 21-July 19, 2021

Southern Rust, Puccinia polysora, is favored by
high temperature. The pustules are smaller,
rounder and orange in color than common rust.
Unlike Common Rust they develop primarily on
the upper surface of the leaf. Southern Rust
can cause serious yield losses as heavily
infected leaves are killed. There are resistant
hybrids available. Fungicides labeled for rust
control in Arkansas are Tilt, Quilt, Propimax,
Stratego, and Headline, among others.
Homeowners must rely on garden fungicides
containing chlorothalonil. The use of resistant
cultivars is recommended when possible.

Southern Corn Leaf Blight

Southern corn leaf blight (Bipolaris maydis) is
not generally regarded as a serious problem as
good resistance to the disease is available.
However, early heavy infection in a susceptible
cultivar causes severe damage to leaves,
predisposing the plant to stalk rot. Spindle
shaped tan lesions with rounded ends, and buff
to brown borders occasionally with a red tint,
appear first on lower leaves. Race O normally
attacks leaves only whereas Race T attacks
leaves, leaf sheaths, ear husks, ears, cobs, and
stalks. Stalk and leaf sheath infections begin as
purple spots that develop tan-gray centers.
Control consists of planting resistant varieties,
deep tillage to bury debris, crop rotation, and
fungicides where warranted. Fungicides such
as Tilt are effective against the disease.

Northern Corn Leaf Blight

Northern corn leaf blight is common here in the
Midsouth with our warm, humid summers. The
disease is caused by Setosphaeria turnica, and
causes gray-green, elliptical, or cigar-shaped
lesions that are 3-15cm long. Mature lesions
become tan with distinct dark zones of
sporulation. Northern corn leaf blight can
develop very rapidly, resulting in complete
blighting of the leaves. There are many resistant
cultivars to choose from. Cultural controls
consist of deep tillage to bury debris, crop
rotation, and fungicides where warranted.

Fusarium Kernel or Ear Rot

Fusarium kernel or ear rot is found wherever
corn is grown. The disease can be severe when
hot, dry weather occurs at and after flowering.
Symptoms are groups or single kernels with
whitish pink to lavender fungal growth on
kernels and/or on silks. Fungal growth at the tip
of the ear has been associated with earworm
damage. In severe cases, the entire ear may
be covered with the fungus. The causative
agents are species of fusarium; Fusarium
moniliforme; FF. proliferatum; and F.
subglutinans. Infection by fusarium can reduce
yields and quality, and result in mycotoxin
accumulation in the grain. Fusarium
overwinters on crop debris. Plowing under the
debris may be helpful. Management strategies
consist of debris management, proper fertility,
moisture control, and insect control. Hybrids
vary widely in their susceptibility.

Gibberella Stalk Rot

Gibberella stalk rot, caused by Gibberella
maydis, has symptoms that are like those of
other stalk rots. Plants wilt, the leaves change
to a dull green, and lower stalks become straw
colored. Red discoloration inside the stalk and
disintegration of the pith are diagnostic for
Gibberella stalk rot.

Corn Charcoal Rot

Charcoal rot symptoms are like other stalk rots.
It can be differentiated by the presence of
numerous, minute, black sclerotia on the
vascular bundles and inside the rind, causing
the interior of the stalk to appear gray black.
The causal organism is Macrophomina
phaseolina, the same fungus that causes
charcoal rot in beans. Root stress related to
drought and/or too much water can cause
charcoal rot.

Corn Anthracnose Stalk Rot

Anthracnose stalk rot, caused by
Colletotrichum graminicola, is recognized late
in the season by the shiny black color on the
outer stalk. The black color may be uniform or
blotchy. The stalk can be easily crushed at the
point of discoloration. The pathogen may rot

Corn Diplodia Ear Rot

Weather conditions this growing season have
been ideal for corn diseases. Diplodia ear rot is
most severe when corn follows corn and wet
weather occurs shortly after silking. The disease
is caused by the fungus, Stenocarpella maydis.
Symptoms are bleached to straw-colored husks.
A conspicuous gray to white mycelial growth
may be observed over the entire ear. The
growth typically starts at the base of the ear and
moves upward. The ear may appear shrunken
with the infected kernels glued to the husk by
the fungal growth. Late in the season, black
pycnidia may be observed on the husks,
kernels, cobs, and rotted stalks. Stenocarpella
maydis is also responsible for an important stalk
rot of corn. It can be distinguished from other
stalk rots by the presence of sub epidermal,

minute, dark brown to black pycnidia in the rind
tissue of the lower stem. The two most
important methods of reducing the incidence of
Diplodia ear and stalk rot are crop rotation and
fall tillage of corn residue.

Corn Red Leaf

Red leaves and/or red stems with barren stalks
may be caused by a broken midrib, or low
fertility, dense plant populations, aphid, or
herbicide damage, chewed off silks, or poor
timing of silking and pollen’ shed. An
accumulation of — sugars and other
photosynthetic products in leaves and sheaths
of barren stalks produces the red coloration.

Corn Kernel Abortion

It is not unusual to see kernels abort at the tip
of the ear since they are the youngest and the
farthest from the incoming food source. This
occurs in the blister or early milk stages.
Occasionally, kernels may abort in 2 or 3
columns that run the entire length of the ear.
Basically, any kind of stress that reduces the
photosynthate supply may cause kernel
abortion. Drought stress is a major culprit.

of corn, resulting in substandard ears. Poor
pollination is due to environmental issues such
as drought, winds, storms, and_ nutritional
issues.

Corn Stinkbug

Several species of stinkbug feed on corn. They
pierce the husk and inject salvia into the
kernels to aid in digestion and extraction of
plant juices. Fresh damage appears as pinkish
discolored kernels. As the ear ages, the
damaged kernels become darkened and
shriveled. Feeding on young leaves results in
stunted plants, wrinkled leaves, pinholes, and
whorl leaves failing to expand. The pinholes
can expand to up to one inch in diameter, often
surrounded by dead, brown tissue, and a
yellow halo. Heavily injured plants that are not
killed by the feeding will grow new lateral tillers.
Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides may be used
when there is one stinkbug per five plants.
