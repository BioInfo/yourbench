Executive Summary

The Arkansas Irrigation Yield Contest is a novel approach to promoting the adoption of
Irrigation Water Management Practices. While there is a monetary prize for motivation, the peer
comparison is believed to be a key feedback mechanism that drives improvement in irrigation
acumen. The contest recognizes those that have achieved a highly developed skill to manage
water resources. The impact of water management practice technologies are also quantified
through this program. The 2022 Irrigation Yield Contest results were significant and created
many success stories. Many of the contest producers stated that adoption of the WM tools such
as watermark sensors and surge valves have a cost and time commitment in the first year to

establish trust and acceptance, but in the end are beneficial at reducing labor and input costs.

In 2022, there were 29 producers from 16 counties throughout the Arkansas Delta who entered
33 fields in the contest. Two of the growers entered multiple crops and/or fields. The contest is
an opportunity for farmers to explore their individual aptitude to reduce energy, water use, labor,
and improve profitability. There are three categories available: Corn, Soybean, and Rice, with a
sub category for Flooded Rice and Furrow Rice. Each producer (except for flooded rice entries)
used at least one irrigation management tool (e.g., computerized hole-selection; multiple-inlet
rice irrigation; soil moisture sensors; surge irrigation). In 2022, the trend of improving water use
efficiency by the winners in multiple crops was broken. In the soybean category, 2 contestants
achieved more than 4 bushels/inch WUE. In 2021, 3 contestants achieved that level, while in
2020, 7 contestants achieved that mark, and in 2018 there were none.

Rules specific to the irrigation contest were developed and posted on a website along with
the necessary entry and harvest forms. The contest was adapted from traditional yield contests
(Arkansas Soybean Association, 2014; National Corn Growers Association, 2015; National
Wheat Foundation, 2018; University of California Cooperative Extension, 2018). Unlike
traditional yield contests, the Arkansas Irrigation Contest winners are selected based on the
highest Water Use Efficiency (WUE), where WUE is defined as the yield estimate divided by the
total water received by the field. Total water includes rain plus irrigation. Rain was estimated
from meteorological computer models, and irrigation water was measured with a portable
propeller-style flow meter that was installed in a tamper-proof fashion. As in traditional yield

contests, the yield estimate at harvest was supervised and witnessed by impartial observers

=== New Page ===

(Extension and or NRCS workers). Of the three categories, nine winners were selected and
awarded prizes totaling $62,809.

Poinsett County producer James Wray placed first in the corn division with a WUE of 12.43
bushels/inch. Mississippi County producer Heath Donner was second in the corn division with a
WUE of 7.23 bushels/inch. Third place was awarded to Terry Smith of Greene County, with a
WUE of 6.11.

Mississippi County producer Cody Fincher was awarded first place in the soybean division
with a WUE of 4.25 bushels/inch. Crittenden County producers Rieves Wallace and John
Wallace were second with a WUE of 3.65 bushels/inch. Cross County Producer Karl Garner was
third with a WUE of 3.57 bushels/inch.

Cross County producer Karl Garner was awarded first place in the flooded rice division,
with a WUE of 7.66 bushels/inch. Crittenden County producer Mark Felker placed second,
achieving a WUE of 6.56 bushels/inch. Crittenden County producer Rieves and John Wallace
placed third achieving a WUE of 4.57 bushels/inch.

Jefferson County producer Chad Render was first in the furrow rice division. He achieved a
WUE of 7.94 bushels/inch. Crittenden County producers Rieves and John Wallace were second
with a WUE of 6.38 bushels/inch. Lonoke County producer Matt Morris placed third achieving a
WUE of 6.22 bushels/inch.

Chad Render is the overall winner of the rice division, meaning he will receive the full list
of prizes. First place in the flood division will receive the rice seed prize.

Awards were sponsored by Ricetec, the Arkansas Corn and Grain Sorghum Promotion
Board, the Arkansas Soybean Promotion board, McCrometer, Seametrics, Delta Plastics,
Irrometer, Trellis, FarmLogs, and Agsense. Crop X provided moisture sensors to a number of
contestants.

Each participant receives an individualized report card, providing feedback on their WUE
and yield performance compared to the aggregated results from all the entries. The contest is
strongly supported by the volunteer efforts of NRCS field offices and Extension agents who
serve as supervisors for the contest. The irrigation industry and commodity boards also supported
the contest through product and cash donations. The effort and support of these persons and

organizations is greatly acknowledged.

Introduction

The overall objectives of the irrigation contest are,

Educate producers on the benefits of using Irrigation Water Management Practices to
improve profitability, sustainability, and reduce labor requirements for irrigation.
Document the highest achievable Water Use Efficiency by crop type under irrigated row
crop production in Arkansas.

Reward and recognize producers who achieve a high level of irrigation water
management acumen among their peers.

Transfer knowledge of good irrigation water management practices from contestants to
irrigation peers and to those that advise irrigators.

Provide a platform for demonstrating Irrigation Water Management Practices at county
and local levels.

Provide a feedback mechanism for irrigators to benchmark their irrigation management

skills.

Participation in the contest is entirely voluntary. Generally, the distribution of the contestants and

contest winners are well distributed across the delta.

Materials and Methods

Rules were drafted in the spring of 2018 then refined each year. The contest rules are
inspired by long-standing yield contests (Arkansas Soybean Association, 2014; National Corn
Growers Association, 2015; National Wheat Foundation, 2018; University of California
Cooperative Extension, 2018). Close attention was given to make the competition as unobtrusive
to normal planting and harvest operations as possible while preserving the ability to produce
accurate data and maintain a fair competition. In 2020 a change to how the growing season was
determined was done for soybeans for more consistency. Harvest yield estimates are similar to or
adapted from the California Rice Yield Contest, National Corn Growers Association Yield
Contest, National Wheat Yield Contest, and the Arkansas ““Go for the Green” Contest.
Contestants harvest a minimum of three acres, harvested from the top of the field to the bottom,
skipping two harvest machine widths between paths. A supervisor and a flowmeter are required
to participate in the contest. UADA staff facilitate the contest, however a panel of impartial

irrigation experts serve as judges to review methods and confirm the results.
Water Use Efficiency

Water use efficiency (WUE) is defined as the amount of yield produced per unit of water

input. Irmak et al. (2011) defines Crop Water Use Efficiency as:
WUE, - Yi / (Pe +IR +A SW) Equation 1

where WUE» = benchmark water use efficiency, Yi= yield of irrigated crop (bu/ac), Pe= effective
rainfall (in), IR = Irrigation applied (in), and A SW = change in soil water content in the root
zone during the growing season (in). For the irrigation contest, this same equation is used,
without consideration of A SW. Given the high rainfall amounts experienced in Arkansas, the
soil water content is relatively high during the first month of emergence, so it is assumed that
contestants begin the season with a full or nearly full profile. Also, estimating this parameter
adds unnecessary complexity to determining the results of the contest.

A challenge in determining WUE is the difficulty in estimating effective precipitation.
Effective precipitation is defined as the amount of rainfall that is stored by the soil after the
excess leaves the field as runoff. The precipitation events for each contestant were carefully
evaluated for magnitude and impact on the results. There are dozens of published methods to

estimate effective precipitation, however, they are all untested in this region. Rather than try to

=== New Page ===

select a method to estimate effective precipitation using a published method, effective rainfall is
defined as less than 2 inches for thirty days after emergence and 3 inches for the remainder of the
season until maturity. Rainfall events over 2 inches in depth are reduced to 2 inches for the first
30 days after emergence. After 30 days from emergence, any rain events that exceed 3 inches are
reduced to 3 inches. Most furrow irrigation events are nearly 3 inches; this is the reasoning
behind using 3 inches as an effective rainfall depth. With this adjustment, in 2018, 2019 and
2020 there were only a few extreme events and the adjustment did not have any impact on the
results. In 2021, a significant rain event occurred south of Interstate 40 over a 6-day period from
June 5 through June 10. Total rainfall ranged from 11.9” to 6.4”, and the adjustments were
minimal. This affected approximately 5 growers. In the future, more work may be needed to
develop a regionally specific adjustment for effective rainfall.

Equation 2 was used to calculate the water use efficiency
for each contestant is defined as the harvest yield estimate divided by the total water delivered to
the field,

WUE = Y/ (Pe + IRR) Equation 2
where WUE = Water Use Efficiency in bushels per inch, Y = Yield estimate from harvest in
bushels per acre, Pe = Effective precipitation in inches, and IRR = Irrigation application in ac-

inches/ac.
Meter Sealing

Irrigation amounts were totalized using 6”, 8”, or 10” portable propeller meters

manufactured by McCrometer. Each meter was sealed using the following process.

e Meters were sealed to the universal hydrant by
using circle lock clamps or horseshoe clamps

e Serialized cable ties are used to secure the clamps
and fittings. These cables can only be removed by
cutting the cable.

e The fitting connections are wrapped with poly pipe

tape.

Figure 1. Example of Universal Hydrant Sealing

e A unique identifying stamp is used across the tape.

=== New Page ===

Universal hydrants are secured to the alfalfa valve and from the alfalfa valve to the meter using
the same procedure. Any additional fittings, if needed, are also secured using this procedure to

ensure that no other irrigation water source can contribute to the field. Figure 1 shows a typical
meter sealing configuration. All other possible sources of irrigation water to that field were

sealed to prevent non-measured irrigation sources from being used in the contest field (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Example of an alfalfa valve sealing done to exclude other sources.

Only mechanical propeller meters are used in the contest. For the winning entries, all
meters are checked against a reference meter and must test within 5% of the reference meter, or
else the water use is adjusted according to the reference meter and the contest results adjusted

accordingly.
Assigning Days to Measure Rainfall

Part of the rainfall measurement is the decision concerning exactly which days to
measure rainfall for each field. The intent is to measure rainfall from emergence to physiological
maturity. For every crop field entered in the contest the planting date is the basis for emergence
date which is recorded on every entry form. Seven days after the planting date is the assumed
emergence date and rainfall contributions are accumulated from then until maturity. Corn is the
most straightforward crop to assign the date of physiological maturity. Seed companies publish
their maturity information in sales literature. Published days to maturity are used to determine
the time after emergence. Emergence is assumed as 7 days after planting. This defines the
period for which rainfall contributions are accumulated.

For rice, the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture DD50 models are used
(Hardke, 2020). Such models can be used to plan fertilizer, pesticide, and scouting decisions.
The UA DDSO program (dd50.uaex.edu) requires the variety, location, and emergence date, then

returns dates of growth stage management events. The predicted drain date for the planted

=== New Page ===

variety for each contestant is used as the last day to measure rainfall on that contest field.
Emergence date is assumed as 7 days after planting. The rainfall between these periods is

accumulated for the precipitation contribution for each contestant field.

For soybeans, the previous method was to use commercially available published data, but
in 2020 the following procedure was adopted. A similar process is used to establish the
emergence data, 7 days after the planting date reported. The end of rainfall accumulation is
assumed to be at R 6.5. This is chosen so that late season rainfalls do not penalize contestants, as
it is assumed that R 6.5 would be the latest that rainfall accumulations would affect yield. Next
the University of Arkansas soybean crop model SoyStage (http://soystage.uark.edu) is used to
model the growth stages. SoyStage (Figure 4 )was developed using Arkansas research trials (dos
Santos et al., 2014; Salmeron et al., 2015; Salmeron et al., 2016; Weeks et al., 2016; Salmeron et
al., 2016; Salmeron et al., 2017). The SoyStage model provides R5 and R7 but not R6.5. To
determine R6.5 the Mississippi State University Extension, Maturity Date Calculator —
SoyPheno (https://webapps.msucares.com/deltasoy/) is used to determine R6 for the maturity
group and planting date reported by the contest grower (Mississippi State University, 2020).
Then the difference in the dates from R7 from SoyStage and R6 from SoyPheno are used to
determine the R6.5 date. Rainfall is accumulated from the assumed emergence date until this

estimated R6.5 date.

Rainfall Estimation

Farmlogs™ (Ann Arbor, MI) was used exclusively for 2021. Comparisons between
Farmlogs™ and Climate Corporations Fieldview™ (San Francisco, CA) were done in 2020, with
similar results. Both programs are computer-based services that provide rainfall estimates for
user defined areas, using mobile apps or internet browsers. For the contest, rainfall amounts for
each contest site using the data provided on entry forms was used to track rainfall contributions
to the fields. The rainfall values were added with total applied irrigation to get the total water

use. Figure 5 shows the total rain during the growing seasons the contest has been conducted.

Figure 5. Average Total Rainfall for contest locations
The precipitation was assessed for each contest site utilizing the commercial rain prediction
service, Farmlogs™. This service uses a computer algorithm to determine rain intensity derived
from National Weather Service products. This approach is used instead of rain gages so that
tampering of rainfall data is not possible. The rainfall generated data may not be completely
accurate against a well-maintained weather station, but it is assumed to be equally unbiased

across all contest sites.

Farmlogs™ and Fieldview™ produced similar results when compared to rain gauges. An
absolute match was not necessary in terms of data accuracy because it was more important to
collect rain information for every location from one method, but these two programs were used
to check against each other for consistency. Also, for the contest, accumulated seasonal rainfall
was considered more important than single event accuracy.

When deciding which computer model to use, the first source was the National Weather
Service (NWS), but their data was more difficult to obtain because it is part of an estimation
product that required some interfacing. Farmlogs™ was easier to use because rain data was
provided in tabular form. Farmlogs™ utilizes raw weather data from the NWS then establishes a
proprietary model to estimate precipitation for a given location. Climate Corp Fieldview™
application was found to be dependable as well for rain data collection. Retrieving data from
Fieldview™ was more difficult and time consuming than Farmlogs™. A difference between the
programs was that Fieldview™ reported more events but less rain per event, where Farmlogs™
reported fewer events but larger ones. For example, Fieldview™ reported several small events
but the total would be near to one reported event by Farmlogs™. However, the difference in the
total rainfall depth reported was not significantly different. Because of the ease in reporting,
Farmlogs™ was used for the contest. Rainfall estimation seems to under report heavy rainfall
events compared rain bucket data. However, Farmlogs™ seems to report high rainfall more often

than Fieldview™. Table 2 shows the mean rain data comparing locations where tipping bucket

=== New Page ===

rain stations are located and where predictions for Farmlogs™ rainfall to Fieldview™ rainfall
estimates were compared.

The 2018 and 2019 18 locations of raw data were compared to the rain prediction services,
Farmlogs™ and Fieldview™. A one- way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was done to test if
there were numerical differences between rain gage data and the estimates generated from
Farmlogs™ and Fieldview™. The differences between the groups were not significantly
different (p=0.95), and the data was found to have equal variances and normality. The lack of
difference suggests that using the computer rainfall prediction method is a reliable way to
determine rainfall contributions to contest fields. Additional data will be collected in future years
to confirm the reliability and accuracy of this approach to rainfall estimation for the contest. At
this time, it appears the use of using Farmlogs™ to estimate season long rainfall is appropriate.

Table 2 shows the irrigation system type, maturity, planting date and season long rainfall
for each of the contest categories, corn, rice, and soybeans. Most of the contestants use furrow
irrigation and similar maturities for the contest.

Harvest Yield Estimate

The yield estimate for the contest is determined by harvesting a three-acre sample of the
contest field. Every contest field harvest was witnessed or supervised by a third party.
Supervisors must not have a financial interest in the contest field. In most cases extension agents
and or NRCS personnel are contest supervisors.

Supervisors are encouraged to help with the decision making of irrigation decisions and

=== New Page ===

can be involved during the season. Harvest operations were witnessed by supervisors or
University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture (UADA) staff designated on the entry form.
Before harvest, the combine grain hopper, grain cart, and truck hoppers are inspected and
confirmed to be empty. A minimum of three acres was harvested and weighed using a certified
scale. The supervisor witnesses the full and tare weighing of the harvest truck.

Yields are adjusted to 12% moisture for rice, 13.0% for soybeans and 15.5% for corn.
Foreign matter % is deducted from the yield for corn and soybeans. Harvested area must be
measured and certified by a supervisor. The contest harvest area was generally determined by
measuring row lengths and width of cut, regardless of the crop. Measurements were taken using
a digital rangefinder. Passes must be from the top to the bottom of the field with as many passes
as necessary from the top and bottom to facilitate harvest of at least 3 acres.

In 2019, a minimum yield requirement was added to account for deficit irrigation and
reasonable commercially acceptable yields. It is well known by irrigation scientists that high
Water Use Efficiency (WUE) can be achieved through deficit irrigation. For 2021, minimum
yield was set at 200 BPA for corn, 180 BPA for rice and 60 BPA for soybean. Those minimum
yields were continued for 2022. Thus, the contestants must achieve a commercially acceptable
yield and a high WUE to win. As the contest develops the judge panel can use past results to

further justify a fair minimum yield.

=== New Page ===

2022 Contest Participants & Field

Requirements

The 2022 Arkansas Irrigation Yield Contest was conducted on 33 commercial fields that
were 30 acres or larger from across the Arkansas Delta. Sixteen counties participated in the
program: Arkansas, Cross, Crittenden, Drew, Greene, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lee, Lincoln,
Lonoke, Monroe, Mississippi, Phillips, Poinsett, Woodruff, and White counties totaling 1374
acres. The field must have only one irrigation water source or riser to the field (multiple pumps
may supply the field through a single hydrant). Entries are for flooded rice, furrow rice,
soybeans, and corn. A contestant may enter the competition with more than one crop but may not
win for more than one crop per year. First-place winners may never win or enter the same crop
again, but are allowed to enter other crops in subsequent years. Unlike other yield contests that
have multiple categories and production systems represented, the irrigation contest is limited:
This limitation is meant to recognize as many irrigators as possible given the limited resources
available. Contestants must be 18 years old at the time of entry, and promotion board members
(and their spouses) who support the contest are not allowed to enter in the respective commodity

category contest.

Irrigation Water Management Tools

Contestants were asked about the Irrigation Water Management (IWM) tools they would
utilize on the contest field when they enter the contest. All but two of the contestants used
Computerized Hole Selection (Pipe Planner or PHAUCET or the Rice Irrigation app) during the
2020 growing season in their contest fields. Table 4 shows mixed use of sensors in the contest
field. However, it is common, when sensors are used. to see them be used for decision making in
several adjacent fields. Considering this, it is possible sensors are being used by contestants at a
rate higher than these numbers indicate. The data from entry forms is incomplete, but shows
positive change in computerized hole selection use. Furrow Irrigated Rice (FIR) continues to be

a popular practice to use and increased from previous years.

Contest 5 Year Data

The Arkansas Irrigation Yield Contest’s primary goal is to encourage the use of irrigation

water management tools by farmers. As an added benefit, data from 149 fields have been

recorded across the delta region. Most importantly the WUE of each field was determined.

Though WUE data from production fields can be found intermittently from various sources such

as the Arkansas verification fields, a large data set of WUE from a number of locations across

multiple years is not readily available. The data set from the competition, in addition to WUE,

also provides the yield, applied irrigation, adjusted rainfall, and total water applied.

An effort was made to compare data from the four years the contest was conducted, but it

is difficult to infer trends in WUE over the years due to the variation among contestants’ results.

A wide range of management styles and field conditions are represented. Figure 8 shows the

distribution of WUE over the five years.

The data was then combined from all five years for each crop. This data can be seen in Table 5

for soybeans,
Table 6 rice, and

Table 7 corn.

The average WUE over the 5-year period for soybean was 3.27 Bu/In, the average for corn was

8.57 Bu/In, and the average for rice was 5.01 Bu/In.

=== New Page ===

In the WUE calculation, the amount of rainfall that the field receives can be a large

component in the total water. More rain does not always translate to less irrigation water needed,

but WUE is determined by both rain and irrigation water. By plotting rainfall against WUE using

all three years, linear regression and goodness of fit was determined. Across all three crop types,

no linear relationship was found between rainfall and WUE Figure 9. Adjusted rainfall is used in

this calculation because it was what was used in determine the WUE, but less than ten of the 149

data points have an adjusted rainfall that differs from the recorded rainfall. Thus, the amount of

rainfall received is not a factor in the WUE results.

By plotting the yield against the WUE, linear regression was performed to determine the

goodness of fit between WUE and yield as shown in Figure 10. Across all three crop types there

is no significant relationship between yield and WUE. While it may appear that there is

relationship between lower yields and lower WUE, in most instances the fields that are on the

lower ends were irrigated as if they would yield higher but had some sort of yield issue. This

causes a normal amount of water to be used with a below normal yield resulting in a lower

WUE. Thus, the yield obtained is not a significant factor in the end WUE for a contest entry.

determined, and meter readings were calculated and verified. The yield estimates were then

taken from the verified harvest forms and the WUE was determined. Contestants were ranked

from high to low. The winning meters were checked against a reference meter to confirm

accuracy within five percent. The contest results were presented to a panel of three judges, who

are experts in the field of irrigation, to review the technical methods used to determine the

rankings. The judge panel reviewed the rankings and confirmed the results.

The following chart reports the average Water Use Efficiency for each crop category in the

contest for comparison to the winners WUE. Water use efficiency is reported in bushels of grain

per volume of irrigation water and precipitation depth. Soybeans averaged 3.2 bushels per inch,

the rice category averaged 5.46 bushels per inch and corn averaged 7.2 bushels per inch.

Reference to the irrigation water use and yields in Arkansas Verification Programs is
only done for reference to other measured water use and yield estimates for commodity crops
and should only be interpreted as an average water use one may expect from these crops under

average recent history conditions.

Corn Contest Results

Overall, 5 corn fields were entered into the contest, with one being ineligible for prizes
being that it was a state entity. The average yield of corn grown for the contest was 196.7 BPA
and the average water use efficiency of corn grown for the contest was 7.2 bushels/inch (Table
8). This average yield was 8.67% higher than the state average for 2019 of 181 BPA (USDA
National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2019). Corn yield was corrected to 15.5% moisture for
every field. The highest yielding corn field was in Poinsett County with a yield of 210.6 BPA.
The water use efficiency ranged from a high of 7.47 bushels/inch to a low of 6.11 bushels/inch.
The average irrigation water added to corn contest fields was 14.0 inches. The highest irrigation
water added to a corn contest field was 18.8 inches and the lowest irrigation water added was
with 12.0 inches of irrigation. One field was withdrawn from the contest prior to harvest. Two

fields did not meet the minimum yield of 200 BPA.

Rice Contest Results

The Rice Irrigation Contest produced a broad range of results in terms water use between
the producers. In 2022, furrow irrigated rice was used in seven contest fields with an average
yield of 164.3 BPA and an average WUE of 5.50 bushels/inch. Flood irrigation was used on four
fields. The average yield was 210.3 BPA and average WUE was 5.7 bushels/inch. Tabular results
from the rice contest are shown in Table 9. Five entries did not meet the minimum yield in Row
Rice, and one did not meet the minimum yield in flood irrigation. Five fields were planted with
FP 7521, two fields were planted with RT7321 FP, two fields were planted with RT7321 FP, one
field was planted with RT7231, two fields were planted with DG 263, and there was one field of
Diamond.

The average rice yield in the contest was 181.1 BPA and the average rice water use
efficiency was 5.5 bushels/inch Table 9. The yield average for the rice contest was 8.4% higher
than the state average rice yield of 167 BPA for 2019 (USDA National Agriculture Statistics
Service, 2019).

The average yield for all rice fields were corrected to 12% moisture. Yields in the rice
contest ranged from a high of 250.7 BPA (flooded rice) to a low of 125 BPA (row rice). The
average irrigation water added for all contest rice fields was 23.2 inches. The highest irrigation

water applied to a contest rice field was 47.1 inches and the lowest amount of irrigation water

added to a contest rice field was 8.6 inches (Table 9). The average WUE was 5.50 Bu/in.
Soybean Contest Results

Nine fields were entered in the soybean division. The average yield for all soybean contest
fields was 82.3 BPA (55.6% above the state average yield of 52.9 BPA) (USDA National
Agricultural Statistics Service, 2017). The soybean contest average water use efficiency was 3.5
bushels/inch (Table 10). All contest fields were corrected to a 13.5% moisture for the soybean

yields considering harvest conditions.

Conclusions

The Arkansas Irrigation Yield Contest is a novel approach to promoting the adoption of
Irrigation Water Management Practices. While there is a monetary prize, for motivation, the
feedback mechanism that provides data to each contestant on how they compare to their peers
provides each participant with a benchmark to improve water management skills and to
recognize those that have achieved a highly developed skill to manage water resources. The
impact and synergisms of utilizing the many water management practice technologies that are
available are also quantified through this program. The 2022 Irrigation Yield Contest results
were significant and created many success stories. Soybeans achieved the highest water use
efficiency since the beginning of the contest. Many of the contest producers stated that adoption
of the IWM tools such as watermark sensors and surge valves have a cost and take time in the
first year to establish trust and acceptance, but in the end are beneficial at reducing labor and

input costs.
