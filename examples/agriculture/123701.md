Tree galls

The clinic received several shade tree samples
last week with galls on the leaves or twigs. Galls
are abnormal growths of tissue caused by a
reaction between chemicals produced by an
insect or mite and plant hormones. The
resulting gall structure protects the invader and
its eggs from chemicals, predators, and
provides a rich food source. Once the gall
appears remedial actions are ineffective except
for pruning. Leaves and twigs showing galls . . .
may be pruned out and destroyed where Oak Vein Gall- Macrodiplosis
practical. This reduces the insect population quercusoroca

and provides some relief for the following
season. If chemical control is attempted sprays
should be applied at bud break the following
spring. Fortunately, most galls leaf and twig
galls are harmless to the plant.

Tomatoes

Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is appearing
across the state. Symptoms include stunting,
wilting, and sometimes a one-sided growth
habit. Young leaves often turn a bronze color
with numerous dark spots. Growing tips may
die back. Young plants with these symptoms
will usually not produce fruit. Older plants will
fruit, but the fruit will have chlorotic rings. There
is no cure or treatment for this viral disease.
Affected plants should be pulled up and
destroyed to prevent the disease from being
spread to new plants by thrips. The clinic has a
test for TSWV that only takes 30 minutes to run.
We also test for cucumber mosaic virus and
tomato mosaic virus.

Fusarium wilt is another tomato problem we’ve
been seeing. Young plants are often stunted
with drooping leaves. The vascular system will
be brown, and the bases of infected stems
enlarged. On older plants the symptoms often
develop on one side of the plant with leaflets
turning yellow and drooping. There is no cure
or treatment. Plants with Fusarium wilt should
be pulled up and destroyed. Resistant varieties
are available.

Early blight is appearing and starting to cause
some serious damage. It first appears as small
brownish black lesions, often with yellow halos
on the older foliage. Large spots will have
concentric rings in the dark brown area of the
spot. Plants can become completely defoliated
by this disease. The lesions may also be found
on stems and fruit. Fungicides give good
protection and should be applied at the first sign
of infection. There are resistant varieties
available.

Another problem of tomatoes this time of year
is bacterial disease. Bacterial canker causes
a systemic wilt of the plant. Lower leaves
usually wilt first. Adventitious roots may form
on the stem. Stems may display brown streaks
with cankers often but not always forming.
Eventually the pith becomes discolored. This
disease is often confused with bacterial wilt but
does not produce as much bacterial streaming.
Crop rotation is encouraged with both
diseases. Several tomato cultivars have some
resistance to bacterial wilt.

Pepper

Bacterial spot of pepper is a serious disease
afflicting pepper and tomato. On pepper black
circular spots appear on the leaves, with a pale
tan central area giving a shot hole effect. On a
heavily infected leaf the spots will merge and
give the appearance of early blight. Leaves
become distorted, shrivel, and fall off. On
tomatoes the spots are surrounded by a yellow
halo. Streams of rod-shaped bacteria may be
observed under the microscope. Fruit will get
small dark brown to black raised spots
rendering them unmarketable. Overhead
irrigation should be avoided where possible.
Clean seed and a 2-year crop rotation will
reduce incidence. Copper fungicides are
effective at the seedling stage.

Melon

Angular leaf spot is also a_ bacterial
disease. Small round to irregular leaf
spots spread until confined by the veins.
Droplets of bacteria may ooze out. The
leaves will dry in a few days, turn brown,
and their centers will fall out leaving
angular holes. Seed from infected crops
should never be saved. A 2-year rotation
and avoiding cold wet soils go a long way
to reduce incidence. Fungicides are
listed in MP154 but are not always
effective.
