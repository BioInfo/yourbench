Magnolia Verticillium Wilt

Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) is a
staple in the southern landscape. It’s grown for
its stately size, glossy evergreen leaves, and
lovely blooms. They grow best in acidic soils (pH
5.0-6.0). They prefer well drained, loamy, moist,
rich soils. Magnolias are best grown in part
shade to full sun. They have large water
requirements, needing 40-80 inches of water a
year. They do not do well however in heavy
soggy soils. Many of the leaf samples that come
to us at the Plant Health Clinic are simply older
leaves that the tree is shedding or preparing to
shed. Although evergreen, Southern Magnolia
begin dropping leaves in the fall through early
spring as they replace their leaves a few ata
time. The degree of leaf drop depends on
genetic and physiological factors affecting the
tree. Some will lose most of their leaves before
new foliage comes out. This is unsightly and
often frightens homeowners who feel their tree
has a genuine problem. Magnolias do not suffer
from many serious diseases. They can get
fungal leaf spots which usually do not do much
damage. Insects such as magnolia scale can be
a problem. Blackening of the leaves with sooty
mold is a good indication of scale infestation.

will usually suppress scale. One_ serious
disease problem is Verticillium Wilt caused by
the fungus’ Verticillium albo-atrum or
Verticillium dahlia. Verticillium wilt is a soil-
borne disease with a huge host range. The
fungus invades through the roots and blocks
the water conducting vessels of the plant.
Symptoms are chlorosis, branch by branch
decline and an overall thinning of the canopy.
Eventually death occurs. When twigs or
branches are cut in cross section, streaking
may be seen in the wood. In magnolia the
sapwood is a general brown color, not as
obvious as the green to dark brown streaking
found in other species of trees. Environmental
stresses make trees more vulnerable. There is
no cure for Verticillium wilt. The fungus exists
for a long time in the soil. Therefore, when
choosing a replacement tree or shrub, choose
a resistant species.

Resistant hosts:

Manzanita

Birch

Box Hornbeam

Katsura tree

White rock rose Sage-leaf rock rose Rock rose
Orange, lemon, grapefruit, others
Dogwood

Hawthorn

Eucalyptus

Beech

Fig Locust

Honey locust

Holly

Walnut

Liquidambar, sweet gum

Magnolia Lichenized Algal Leaf Spot

Magnolia Lichenized algal leaf spot is caused
by parasitic algae Cephaleuros virescens. This
organism causes twig cankers and leaf spots.
Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) is
susceptible to infection when hot humid
weather provides optimum conditions for the
growth and spread of this pathogen. Lesions
begin as round, green, velvety colonies on leaf
surfaces or twigs. On leaves, the spots
eventually turn reddish-brown with age. Algal
leaf spot that has been colonized by fungi take
on a grayish appearance and are called
Lichenized algal leaf spot. The disease is most
severe on Magnolias that are weak and in poor
health. Trees that are grown in full sun and
subjected to elevated temperatures and
excessive leaf wetness are more severely
affected. Cultural practices to minimize
disease include a proper water and fertilization
schedule. A soil sample should be taken to
rule out nutritional and pH issues. Irrigation
methods that spray water on the leaves should
be avoided. All fallen leaves and twigs should
be raked up and destroyed. Pruning
overhanging branches from _ surrounding
plants will improve air circulation. Lastly
Applications of copper fungicides (Kocide)
every 2 weeks during wet weather have
proven helpful.

Magnolia Shearia Canker

Magnolias that are environmentally stressed
are also subject to a canker disease called
Shearia dieback of magnolia, causal agent
Shearia fusa. The most common magnolia
cankers diseases are Botryosphaeria, nectria
and Shearia. Shearia dieback is a fungal
disease that causes trunk and branch cankers,

resulting in dieback of plant parts above the
cankered area. Premature leaf drop, yellowing
and branch dieback are symptoms. Root
problems cause similar symptoms, so check
carefully for limbs with sunken cankers before
assuming Shearia dieback. Prune cankered
branches from the tree and destroy or
otherwise remove from the property. Submit
soil to check that the soil profile is optimal for
magnolia culture. Fungicides are not effective
against canker diseases.

Los arboles de magnolia que estan en
condiciones de estrés son mas susceptibles a
ser afectados por enfermedades que causan
chancros en tallos y ramas._ Las
enfermedades chancrosas mas comunes en
magnolia son: Botryosphaeria, nectria y
Shearia. Shearia chancro es causada por el
hongo Shearia fusa. Esta enfermedad fungida
causa chancros en el tallos y ramas,
ocasionando muerte superior de la rama o
tallo desde donde se encuentra el chancro.
Otros sintomas son: — amarillamiento,
defoliacién prematura, y muerte descendente
de las ramas. Algunos de estos sintomas
también se pueden presentar por algunas
enfermedades que atacan las raices, por esa
razon es importante inspeccionar la presencia
de chancros en las ramas para pensar que
puede ser Sheria chancro. Para el control de
esta enfermedad se recomienda podar y
destruir las ramas afectadas, el uso de
fungicidas no es efectivo para el control de
esta enfermedad. Es recomendado realizar
analisis de suelo para asegurar que el suelo
tiene las propiedades necesarias para el arbol
de magnolia.

Magnolia Freeze Injury

Magnolias in some locations suffered freeze
injury this winter. This is most noticeable on
newest growth. These trees will recover and put
on new growth.
