Wheat Viruses

Soilborne wheat viruses have started showing
up in northeast Arkansas, but they are not
expected to be as damaging as in most years
due to the very dry conditions last fall. Infection
of wheat roots by the soil fungus that transmits
soilborne viruses is favored by moist conditions
and early planting. It is important to understand
which virus occurs in which fields so that you
can select the best resistant variety next year,
so please send in any suspicious samples for
testing.

Other Wheat Diseases

It has been a very mild winter, and the
Arkansas wheat crop looks very promising due
to the dry conditions. Leaf rust and stripe rust
have likely overwintered in the state, although
the recent cold wave with ice and snow helped
destroy some of these fungi that can only
survive on living plants. For this reason, the
rust fungi are called "obligate" parasites or
pathogens. Their fate is tied to their host,
although some rusts can survive on other
plants besides their preferred host. Anyway,
high yield potential wheat fields should be
scouted between now and heading for foliar
diseases. If stripe rust hot spots are noticed,
the fields should be sprayed immediately with
a fungicide otherwise applications should be
delayed until booting to early heading if disease
warrants. Check with the local county
extension agent for additional fungicide
information or check the MP154
https://www.uaex.uada.edu/publications/pdf/m
p154/Wheat-Diseases.pdf and always read the
fungicide label before use.

Pecan Problems
Pecan Drought

Last year (2005) was a near record drought
year in Arkansas and thus was not a good year
for pecans. Pecans do best in deep, rich, well-
drained soils and young trees need 10-15
gallons of water a week, with mature trees
needing 50-80 gallons per day or
approximately 2000 gallons a month. Water is
especially critical during late summer and early

Pecan Scab

Pecan Scab (see next photo) is a serious annual
problem for pecans in Arkansas. While resistant
varieties have been developed, many existing
trees and orchards are planted in susceptible
ones. So, a fungicide spray program is usually
followed by commercial growers who own the
high-pressure sprayers capable of applying
fungicides to large trees. Homeowners have a
more difficult time using fungicides because of
inadequate equipment and the very limited
selection of small-package and legal fungicides.
Therefore, homeowners should practice good
sanitation to reduce the amount of the scab

hauling them off, burying them, composting or

Pecan Stinkbug

Pecan Stinkbug damage to pecan kernels
varies from season to season according to
periodic buildup of this insect. Many stink bug
species are hard to kill with insecticides and
repeated applications may be needed. Product
information is available through the local county
extension office. Some growers have reportedly
had success by planting nearby trap crops of
speckled purple hull peas to attract stinkbugs
away from the pecan orchard and then killing
them while feeding on the peas (Weaver, 1999).

common samples sent to the clinic. Very early
spring is a good time to prune out diseased or
weak canes and rake up fallen leaves that
harbor the black spot fungus. A protectant
fungicide such as Daconil or Immunox should
be applied starting as soon as the first leaves
start to develop (or as soon as possible during
early leafing out) and repeated according to
label directions on susceptible varieties
throughout the spring and summer. In the past,
we have also seen more symptoms of drought
injury to roses than many other shrubs so
adequate watering, especially during dry spells
is very important. Rose experts advise that
blooming roses may need 2 inches of water a
week when growing and no rainfall is received.
