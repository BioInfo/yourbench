Peach

Peaches are about done for this season in
Arkansas, but we are still getting a few samples
of late peaches. There is a lot of homeowners
interest these days in having a small fruit
orchard in the back yard. Of fruit trees, the stone
fruits are probably the most difficult to grow.
Peaches for example, are a difficult crop in
Arkansas. If a late frost doesn’t destroy the
crop, there are plenty of diseases and insects
that can ruin the fruit. We often get peach fruit
with the complaint of a disease when the real
problem is insect. The Oriental Fruit moth,
Grapholitha molesta, is a serious pest of
peaches, plums, apples, cherries, pears, and
nectarines. This insect damages both tender
terminal growths in the spring and the fruit at
midsummer. The adult is a small, charcoal
colored moth with bands of light and dark lines
on the wings. The larvae overwinter in cocoons
in bark crevices and in litter at the base of the
tree. They emerge as moths in the spring as
peaches are blooming and lay eggs on the
leaves near terminal growth. The newly hatched
larvae attack the tender terminal growth near
the base of a leaf. They cause twig dieback by
tunneling down the center of the twig for 2 to 6

inches. There are five or more generations a
year with later hatches feeding on the fruit.
Gum is often exuded from their entry and exit
holes. The larvae usually bore to the center of
the fruit and feed around the pit. Oriental Fruit
Moth larvae can be distinguished from Plum
Curculio larvae by their pinkish color and
because they have legs whereas Plum
Curculio larvae are legless. By mid-March, at
least two pheromone traps per 10-acre block
are set inside the tree canopy at eye level to
monitor moth activity and time insecticide
applications. The trap should be checked twice
a week to note first consistent moth emergence
in late March and start accumulating degree
days (DD) = average daily temperature — 45°F.
Accumulate daily DD from first consistent trap
catch (called biofix) until you reach 400 DD
which is the time to apply insecticide against
hatching larvae (occurs about 6 days after peak
moth flight). Second and third generation hatch
periods occur at 1,300 and 2,100 DD (sprays)
and hatch periods of third to sixth generations
overlap. Scouting for wilted shoots is helpful in
determining early damage and adjusting spray
schedules. Subsequent sprays need to be
applied 3 days after peak flight. Actara 25WP,
Altacor, Asana XL, Avaunt, Imidan, Provado,
and Voliam xpress are labeled for control or
Oriental fruit moth. Orchards larger than 4
acres may find the use of mating disruption
helpful. Attaching at least 100 pheromone
dispensers to middle to upper peach tree
canopy per acre are placed throughout the
orchard, confusing the male moths, and
preventing them from mating effectively.

Canna

Cannas are a very reliable and showy plant in
the sunny landscape. A range of cultivars vary
in size from 2-6ft tall and bloom in colors ranging
through the pink, yellow, orange and red
spectrum. Some cultivars also have showy red
or striped foliage. The most irritating insect pest
of canna is the Canna Leaf Roller. Two species
of canna leaf roller are present in the
Southeastern United States, the larger canna
leaf roller, Calpodes ethlius (Stoll) (Insecta:
Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae), and the lesser canna
leaf roller, Geshna cannalis (Quaintance)
(Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The lesser
canna leaf roller appears to be more common in
our area than the greater, but both have similar
life cycles and management.

Canna leaf rollers, as their name implies, roll
canna leaves, and keep them rolled using silk
produced by larva (caterpillar). This is
accomplished by attaching silk before the leaf
unrolls (preferred by the lesser canna leaf roller)
or by attaching silk to one edge of the leaf and
pulling toward the other edge (usually the larger
canna leaf roller). Once rolled, the leaf provides
a protective area for the caterpillar to feed. The
lesser canna leaf roller caterpillars generally
feed on the surface of the leaf and don’t chew
completely through the leaf, but the larger leaf
roller feeds through the leaf. Later when the leaf
opens, the feeding damage appears as holes in
the leaves and ragged leaf edges.

Canna leaf rollers only feed on plants in the
Genus Canna and close relatives, so other
plants in the garden are not threatened. This
also makes management a little easier because
dead plant material can be cut to the ground in

Systemic insecticides such as Merit, or Bio
Advanced 3-1 Insect & Disease Mite Control, or
Bio Advanced 2-in-1 Systemic Rose & Flower
Care Il may be applied. Alternatively, a product
applied to the leaves containing Bacillus
thuringiensis (BT) gives control without toxicity
to organisms other than members of the
Lepidoptera.

Clematis

Clematis are one of our showiest and reliable
blooming perennial vines. They grow best in full
sun with well-drained, evenly moist soil with a
pH of 6.6-7.0. Usually, the only disease
problem we see on clematis is Clematis Wilt
caused by Calophoma clematidina, formerly
Phoma_ clematidina, formerly Ascochyta
clematidina. This is a fungal pathogen that
causes both leaf spots and stem lesions. When
a stem is girdled by the fungus, the flow of
nutrients is shut off, and wilting occurs. When
the affected stem is sliced open, it appears
black inside. Clematis Wilt seldom kills the
plant. Affected plants almost always
immediately begin to produce new growth from
the crown. All wilted stems should be cut back
to healthy tissue. Homeowners may use
