Update No. 9
General By Chad Norton and Chris Elkins.
WRVP fields continue to develop quickly. Rainy weather continues to be the biggest challenge
facing the 2019 wheat crop. Drier weather at this point would be beneficial and help to reduce
potential disease development. Insect pressure has not been a factor so far this season.
