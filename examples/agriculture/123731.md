Tomato Fruit Abnormalities

Growers are sometimes bewildered when a
tomato fruit grows a nose or horn, or even a pair
of horns. Tomato horns or noses occur because
of an error in cell division. A normal fruit has 4-
6 locules when cut in half. When a few cells
divide wrong they produce an extra locule.
Since there is not enough room inside the fruit
for the extra, a horn or nose protrudes from the
fruit. Extended high temperatures (above 90°F
during the day and 82-85°F during the night)
predisposes the plant toward producing
deformed fruit. Some of the older heirloom
varieties are more susceptible. This does not
affect the taste of the fruit.

Tomato Catfacing

Catfacing is caused by anything that damages
the bloom. This can be cold injury, insect,
herbicide, or storm injury. We typically see this
most on fruit injured by frost when planted too
early in the spring.

Tomato Cracking

Cracking is usually associated with excess
amounts of water. The plant tissue swells with
the water faster than the skin can grow and
cracking occurs. Some varieties are more
prone to cracking than others.

Tomato Graywall

Graywall has been linked to potassium
deficiency among other things. Black to dark
brown necrotic tissue forms in the walls of
tomato fruit infected with Graywall disease. In
most cases only the outer walls are affected.
Wall tissue may partially collapse, causing the
outer skin of the tomato fruit to appear wrinkled.
The area appears woody when cut, and the fruit
is of poor quality. Graywall has been associated
with Tobacco Mosaic Virus, low light conditions
and cool weather as well as potassium

deficiencies. Photo by APS Image Library

Sprouting Inside Tomato Fruit

Sprouting inside fruit occurs in overripe fruit
when seeds have reached maturity and
the natural hormone, abscisic acid
(ABA), is reduced. The tomato fruit
allows sprouting inside (vivipary)
because the seeds do not desiccate (dry
out) in the moist environment inside the
fruit. Some causes of seeds sprouting in

ye Plant Diagnostic Network

tomatoes are long storage in cool
temperatures (below 55 degrees), being
overripe, potassium deficiency, and over
fertilization with nitrogen.

Tomato Blossom End Rot

Both tomato leaves and fruit can suffer from
Tomato Blossom End Rot, calcium deficiency,
although it is relatively rare in the leaves
themselves. Symptoms of calcium deficiency in
the leaves appear at the top of the plant in the
newest growth. Stunting, chlorosis, and
interveinal necrosis are symptoms. Very similar
symptoms may occur with magnesium
deficiency. However, the symptoms will be on
the oldest leaves instead of the newest leaves.
Magnesium deficiency is usually the result of too
much water. Calcium deficiency in tomato fruit
is a localized deficiency in the distal end of the
fruit. Most often with fruit, there is enough
calcium in the soil, but fluctuations in water
prevent the plant from supplying the fruit with
the necessary amount of calcium for healthy
fruit. The fruit develops a light, tan, water-
soaked spot on the end of the fruit. These spots
turn black and leathery. Occasionally, the rot
occurs on the inside of the fruit instead of the
outside. The best management for Blossom End
Rot is good water management practices. Soil
tests should be done at least every two years to
make sure there is an adequate supply of
calcium in the soil. Blossom End Rot can be
alleviated during the growing season by
applying a foliar spray of anhydrous calcium
chloride. Several brands are available including
Tomato Saver and End Rot.

Tomato Phosphorous Deficiency

Several times a season we receive tomato
samples with Phosphorous deficiency.
Tomatoes have high phosphorous
requirements. Phosphorous encourages
healthy root development in seedlings and
strong stems and leaves in developing plants.
Phosphorous promotes fruit development and
boosts the nutritional content of ripening
tomatoes. The most obvious sign of
phosphorous deficiency is a purple discoloration
first on the undersides of leaves and later the
tops. In severe cases the entire plant becomes
purple with curled leaves. Stunting and failure
to thrive are common in phosphorous deficient
plants. One of the most common causes of
phosphorous deficiency is cool garden soil.
Tomato plants require soil temperatures of 60°F
or more to properly uptake phosphorous. Soils

that are too wet also prevent adequate
phosphorous uptake. Having a soil pH either
too acidic or too alkaline also prevents the plant
capability to access available phosphorous.
Soil pH for tomatoes should fall between 6.5
and 7.0. Soil testing should be done at least

every two years and amendment
recommendations followed. Arkansas has
planting, care, and fertilization
recommendations for tomato in our extension
publication FSA6017

http ://jwww.uaex.edu/publications/PDF/FSA-
6017.pdf :

Prior to planting, fertilize with a complete
fertilizer at the rate of 1 pound per 100
square feet of row. Apply 8 ounces of a
starter fertilizer solution (1 tablespoon of
20-20-20 per gallon) when transplanting.
Hoe or cultivate shallowly to keep down
weeds without damaging roots. If you wish
to maintain your plants for full-season
harvest, consider mulching with black
plastic or organic materials.

Water the plants thoroughly every two to
four days during dry periods. Plants in
containers need daily watering. Side-dress
with nitrogen fertilizer at the rate of 1 pound
per 100 feet of row or 1 tablespoon per plant
after the first tomatoes have grown to the
size of golf balls. Make two more
applications three and six weeks later. If the
weather is dry following these applications,
water the plants thoroughly. Do not get
fertilizer on the leaves.

Tomato Stinkbug Damage

Tomato stinkbug damage. Adult stink bugs are
shield-shaped insects with piercing sucking
mouthparts. They get their common name
“Stink bug,” from the strong odor they emit
when disturbed. Several species of stink bugs
feed on tomato fruit as well as on many other
vegetables, fruits, nuts, and field crops. Stink
bug species in Arkansas include the Green
stink bug, Acrosternum hilare (Say), the
Southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula
(Linnaeus), the Brown stink bug, Euschistus
servus (Say) and the Rice stink bug, Oebalus
pugnax (Fabricius). Stink bugs pierce tomato
fruit and inject enzymes from their salivary
glands to liquefy and pre-digest the plant
material. Damage on green tomato fruit
appears as dark pinpricks surrounded by a light
discolored area. On ripe fruit the area around
the feeding site usually turns yellow. If the skin
of the fruit is peeled back, white spots may be
observed on the flesh of the tomato. For stink
bug control, homeowners may use Ortho Max
Flower, Fruit, Citrus, and Vegetable Insect
Control, or Bayer Advanced Insect Control, or
Spectracide Insect Control, or permethrins.
Scouting and handpicking can eliminate a few.
Stinkbug traps are also available.

Tomato Fruitworms

The larvae of several species of moth attack
tomato fruit, including the Corn earworm,
Helicoverpa zea and the Yellowstriped
armyworm, Spodoptera ornithogalli. Tomato
Fruitworms, Helicoverpa zea, are destructive
pests of tomato, corn, and other crops. The
adults are medium-sized moths, pale tan to
brown with a dark spot in the center of the fore
wing. They lay eggs singly on both surfaces of
the leaves. The eggs hatch as creamy white
caterpillars with a dark head. They change
color as they grow and can be shades of brown,
pink, green, or black with alternating light and
dark stripes running lengthwise on their bodies.
The caterpillars begin feeding on the leaves but
move to the fruit as soon as green tomatoes
appear. First noticeable on the fruit is a black

hole at the base of the fruit stem. Inside the fruit,
tunneling, frass and the worm may be found
when the fruit is cut open. When the larvae
reach full size, they migrate out of the fruit, fall
to the ground, and pupate. Adults emerge from
the soil in 10-14 days and begin the cycle again.
Caterpillars of the Yellowstriped armyworm are
up to 2 inches long and may be green when
small to almost black. They have two cream
yellow to orangish stripes along the back, and a
prominent dark spot on the sides of the fourth
body segment behind the head (the first legless
abdominal segment). Partially grown larvae
appear to have pairs of triangular dark markings
along the back of each body segment inside of
the light-colored stripes. Adult moths have a
wingspan of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 inches. Control of
both the Tomato Fruitworm and Yellowstriped
armyworm consists of scouting for the larvae
and handpicking along with chemical controls if
necessary. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a
naturally occurring bacterium that is fatal to
caterpillars when ingested by them, but
harmless to pets, people, and other types of
insects. | Other insecticides may be used
including Baythroid, or Brigade, or Sevin, or
Excel, or Coragen, or Voliam Xpress, or Asana,
or Belt, or Synapse, or Lannate, or Intrepid, or
SpinTor, or Confirm, or Mustang Maxx, or Hero.
Homeowners may use Bt, or Ortho Flower,
Fruit, & Vegetable Insect Killer, or Ortho Bug-B-
Gon Insect Killer for Lawns and Gardens, Sevin,
or Spectracide Insect Control for Gardens, or
permethrins, or spinosad. Chemical control is
ineffective once the fruitworm enters the fruit.

Tomato Hornworm

Two species of Hornworm attack tomato and
other solanaceous crops. The Tomato
hornworm, Manduca quinquemaculata and the
Tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The adult
of both species is a large, robust-bodied moth,
commonly known as a hawk moth or sphinx
moth. The adult moth feeds on the nectar of
flowers and, is most active from dusk until dawn.
Although very similar in appearance the
caterpillars can be identified by small
differences. The tomato hornworm has V-
shaped yellow-white markings on the body and
the tobacco hornworm has white diagonal lines.
Additionally, the horn, that gives the hornworm
its name, is darker on the tomato hornworm.
The caterpillars are voracious eaters and can
strip a tomato plant in just a few days. That said,
they are not difficult to control. Handpicking is

they blend so well with stems and foliage.
Another effective control is the application of a

surface of the plant tissues that eventually takes
on a bronze appearance. Leaves become dry
and brown. Heavy feeding on fruit causes
yellowish speckling across the surface of the
fruit. Serious infestations can kill leaves and
eventually the plant. In heavy infestations, small
webs may be observed. It’s important to
recognize the problem before leaves start dying.
Commercial growers may use Agri-Mek 0.15

insecticidal soaps. Depending on the product
used, applications should be made every 2 to 3
days.

Tomato Herbicide Damage

Every year the Plant Health Clinic receives
samples suffering from herbicide damage.
Vegetables, fruits, and ornamentals are all
quite sensitive to both phenoxy based
herbicides such as 2-4-d, and to glyphosate
damage (Roundup). Roundup is not your
friend in the garden. It will drift up to 1500 ft
across the yard when there is a breeze.
Symptoms of roundup damage to tomato are
bleached white to yellow areas at the base of
leaflets. Strap-like leaves, witches’ brooms,
and leaf curling are some of the symptoms on
other species. Roundup is systemic, so
perennial plants not killed outright will have
damage symptoms again the following season.
