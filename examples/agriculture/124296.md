Weed Control:

Resistant ryegrass infestations require a
program approach. This includes
tillage/herbicide of first “flush” of ryegrass
followed by sequential program of Axiom,
Axiom + Prowl, or Zidua/Anthem Flex in fall
followed by Axial Bold in spring. Residuals
are key! One year fallowing without
allowing seed production will typically
reduce soil seed bank 95%.

Refer to MP 44 for latest herbicide
recommendations.

Seeding:

e Plant seed between 1 to 1.5 inches deep
e Seeding rate should be 26 seeds per ft? with
grain drill under ideal conditions. Increase

Determining Final Plant Stands:

Count the number of plants in one ft? in at
least 10 random locations in the field.
Desired stand is >20 plants per ft?.

With good tillering and uniform stand, 10
plants per ft? can give optimum yields.

Seed Treatments:

Systemic seed insecticides for control of
Hessian fly and aphids to control Barley
Yellow Dwarf Virus are generally not
recommended unless planting early.
Systemic seed applied fungicides are
recommended to control loose smut and
seedling pathogens.

Diseases and Disease Control:

e Fungicides should be applied when disease
is present, or weather conditions favor
disease development. The most important
times for applications are usually between
Feekes GS 8 and 10.5.1

e Leaf rust, stripe rust, septoria tritici blotch,
stagnospora nodorum blotch, glume blotch,
and fusarium head blight (scab) are diseases
commonly found in Arkansas wheat.

e Varieties with resistance to fusarium head
blight, leaf rust and stripe rust should be
planted.

e — Refer to MP 154 Arkansas Plant Disease
Control products guide for the latest
disease recommendations.

e Refer to http://www.wheatscab.psu.edu/
for estimated scab pressure for your area.

Insect Control:
Treatment Levels

o Present and head cutting in spring.
e Grasshopper — When damage is occurring.
e Cereal Leaf Beetle — 1 per stem.
e Aphids — Plant height dependent. Refer to
MP 144 Insecticide Recommendations for
Arkansas for latest insecticide
recommendations and thresholds.
Drainage:
e Field surface should be as smooth and
uniform as possible.
e Install drain furrows with or at a slight angle
to field slope.
e Avoid berm on up-slope side of furrow.
e — End furrows at an unrestricted outlet.

and soybeans.

Pre-plant N Considerations:

Fall seeded wheat generally does not require N

fertilizer for establishment. However, there are

situations where fall applied N should be considered:

1. Late-planted wheat — consider 30 Ib N/acre

regardless of previous crop if planted after:
¢ November 1 for northern Arkansas (north
of Hwy 64).
¢ November 10 for central Arkansas.

¢ November 20 for southern Arkansas
(south of Pine Bluff).
2. Wheat following flood-irrigated rice —

Should receive 45 lb N/acre pre-plant or
shortly after planting or crop emergence.

can be applied in the fall.

Sulfur (S):
If a field has a history of S deficiency, 20 lb S/ac
should be applied in initial late-winter N application.
