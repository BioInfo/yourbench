Average income per acre does not reflect total income per acre. Farmers will receive a gin rebate plus the cotton buyers will purchase equity in the
cotton from the farmers. Small plot cotton variety trials are conducted all throughout the south and in Arkansas, but little info is available with
regard to the influence of fiber quality from a commercial ginned study. The Big Block Cotton Plot was implemented on Eric Scott’s farm. We
planted 48 rows of 10 different cotton varieties from 5 different companies on May 10, 2022. Eric treated this field just like any other cotton field
throughout the growing season. At the end of the season, the cotton varieties were picked according to readiness. Thirty-six rows (4.99 acres) were
picked out of each variety. The round bale modules were then taken to Graves Gin where they were ginned separately. Michelle Copeland at Graves
Gin worked hard to sell the modules individually and put them into the loan separately. This allowed us to be able to see the quality of each of the
varieties of cotton and not just the yield. It helped to see the income per acre, lint yield, leaf grade, turnout, staple, strength, mic, and uniformity.
Discounts associated with excessive leaf and micronaire are common in Arkansas, so that is one thing that made this plot stand out. It showed the
leaf and micronaire of each variety to help farmers compare varieties not just by quantity, but by quality. Sampling and selling each variety
separately shows the differences in quality of each as well as the yield and the price earned from each acre. All varieties defoliated and performed
well, but there were differences in leaf. These differences were associated with variety characteristics. Some varieties may be high lint yielders, but
others may be better quality and bring more dollars per acre even though they might not have picked as much as another variety.
