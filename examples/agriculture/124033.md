May 2022 USDA Supply/Demand Summary

Overview

Corn: The corn crop is projected at 14.5 billion bushels, down 4.3 percent from last year. The corn yield is projected at
177.0 bushels per acre. The very slow start to this year’s planting in the major corn producing States and the likelihood that
progress by mid-May will remain well behind normal reduce yield prospects. Total corn supplies are forecast to decline 2.7
percent to 15.9 billion bushels.

Total U.S. corn use in 2022/23 is forecast to fall 2.5 percent or 370 million bushels on declines in domestic use and exports.
Food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use is virtually unchanged at 6.8 billion bushels. Corn feed and residual use is down 275
million bushels from a year ago to 5.35 billion. U.S. corn exports are forecast to decline 100 million bushels to 2.4 billion in
2022/23 on lower supplies.

2022/23 U.S. ending stocks are down 80 million bushels from last year to 1.36 billion. The season-average corn price
received by producers is projected at $6.75 per bushel, up 85 cents from a year ago and if realized the highest since $6.89
reached during 2012/13.

Soybeans: The 2022 U.S. soybean crop is projected at 4.64 billion bushels, up 5 percent from last year’s crop mainly on
3.8 million acre increase in harvested area. With slightly lower beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected at 4.89
billion bushels, up 4 percent from 2021/22.

The U.S. soybean crush for 2022/23 is projected at 2.26 billion bushels, up 40 million from the 2021/22 forecast. With
increased supplies, U.S. soybean exports are forecast at 2.2 billion bushels, up 60 million from 2021/22. U.S. ending stocks
for 2022/23 are projected at 310 million bushels, up 75 million from last year.

The 2022/23 U.S. season-average soybean price is forecast at $14.40 per bushel compared with $13.25 per bushel in
2021/22. Soybean meal prices are forecast down $20 per short ton from 2021/22 to $400 per short ton.

Long-Grain Rice: Old crop (21/22) ending stocks were increased by 2 million cwt. this month, making the 2022/23
beginning stocks 21.4 million. New crop imports are projected to be record large at 30 million cwt. The net result is total
supplies of 192.3 million, down 10 million from 21/22.

Given lower production, tighter supplies and a higher price outlook, USDA projects a 7 million cwt. reduction in usage in
22/23 to 174 million cwt. Domestic use is expected to drop 4 million from last year, while exports could be down 3 million
cwt. Exports of 61 million would be the lowest since 1996/97.

New crop long-grain ending stocks are projected to be 18.3 million cwt. with a stocks-to-use of 10.5 percent. The projected
stocks-to-use for 22/23 would be the lowest since the 9.9 percent seen in 2019/20. USDA projects the average long-grain
farm price for the 22/23 crop to be $15.50/cwt or $6.98 per bushel. That would be the highest average farm price on record
back to 1982/83.

Cotton: 2022/23 U.S. Production is forecast at 16.5 million bales, based on 12.2 million planted acres as indicated in the
March Prospective Plantings., However, harvested area is expected to be 9.1 million as limited precipitation in the Southwest
suggests more abandonment than average. Exports are expected to fall slightly to 14.5 million bales. At 2.9 million bales,
2022/23 U.S. ending stocks are projected 500,000 bales lower than the year before, and equivalent to 17 percent of total
use. The marketing year average upland farm price is projected at 90 cents per pound.
