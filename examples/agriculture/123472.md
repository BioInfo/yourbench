Sweet Potato

Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus (SPFMV)
can cause considerable yield reduction
wherever sweet potato is grown. In comparison
to susceptible cultivars, virus-free sweet potato
plants yield from 20% to over 100% more than
infected plants. Symptoms on the foliage are
irregular chlorotic or purple feathering along the
veins and faint to distinct chlorotic spots with or
without a purple halo on leaf surfaces. Leaf
symptoms may be entirely absent as they are
dependent on cultivar susceptibility, virus strain,
and stress. Likewise, root symptoms may be
absent, or the roots may exhibit “russet crack”
or “internal cork”. SPFMV is vectored by aphids.
Aphid control is not considered economical in
most cases. Control consists of the use of
resistant cultivars and proper sanitation.
Viruses are not curable.

Fiddle-Leaf Fig

Fiddle-leaf figs, Ficus lyrata, are easy
houseplants to grow. This member of the fig
family can grow up to 12 feet (3.7m) in height
and 6 feet (1.8m) wide. They prefer moderate
to bright light and moderate amounts of water.
Bacterial Leaf Spot, caused by Xanthomonas
campestris, typically causes tan-brown, dry
looking lesions with irregularly shaped margins
and a darker reddish border. The lesions tend
to become tattered as the lesions age. Control
measures are based largely on sanitation,
avoidance of leaf wetness, avoidance of high
rates of nitrogen, and the use of bactericides.
Streptomycin sulfate (Agri-strep), Kocide, and
Mancozeb have some efficacy against bacterial
diseases when combined with good cultural
methods. Both anthracnose leaf spot and the
dead margins caused by lack of water can
cause similar looking lesions.

Rose

Cercospora Leaf Spot of roses can be very
damaging on susceptible cultivars.
Cercospora puderi and Cercospora rosicola
are the species of Cercospora that cause leaf
blights of rose. Symptoms of Cercospora Leaf
Spot include tiny, brown to purple, circular leaf
spots on the leaf surface. The centers of the
spots gradually turn tan to gray. Like Black

spot disease, heavily infected leaves may turn
yellow and fall prematurely. It is important to
maintain good growing conditions for roses.
They should receive at least six hours of direct
sun daily (morning is best) in a site that allows
good healthy air movement around each bush.
A pH of 6.0-6.8 is ideal for roses. Roses require
2 inches (50mm) of water a week for best bloom.
However, overhead irrigation promotes fungal
diseases such as Cercospora Leaf Spot and
Black spot of roses; so, overhead irrigation
should be avoided. Applications of fungicides
such as Compass, Daconil, Eagle, and Heritage
give excellent control when applied every 7-10
days. Homeowners may use BioAdvanced
Garden-Disease Control for Roses, Flowers,
and Shrubs; or Daconil; or Fertilome Liquid
Systemic Fungicide; among others.

Apple

Flyspeck, caused by Schizothyrium pomi, and
Sooty Blotch, caused by Gloeodes pomigena,
are two of the most common fungal diseases
found on apple. These two diseases are
commonly both found together on fruit. The
fungi causing these diseases grow superficially
on the surface of the apple, causing the fruit to
be unsightly and unmarketable. Most of the
apple crop in the southeastern United States
would be affected each year if not for the use
of protective fungicides. Symptoms of
Flyspeck are groups of a few to 50 or more

shiny black, superficial pseudothecia on the
surface of the fruit. The colonies are usually 1-
3cm (3/64-1/8") in diameter or larger, and round
to irregular in shape. Sooty Blotch appears as
colonies of olive green on mature fruit. The
colonies may be discrete and circular to large
blotches with diffuse margins which are sooty in
appearance. Fungicide sprays should be
applied at 10-14-day intervals beginning at
green tip in the spring to provide the best
protection. Adament, Captan, Flint, Pristine,
Sovran, and Topsin M are labeled for control.
Cleanup of fallen fruit and leaves, along with
proper pruning, is also helpful.
