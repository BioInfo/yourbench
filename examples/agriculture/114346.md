Considerations for
Quality Silage

¢ Who is the end user?
— Quality Concerns

¢ Herbicides

* Seed Costs

— Fertility needs do not greatly
differ between corn and
sorghum silage

¢ Will you scout for Sugarcane
Aphids?

¢ Planting Window

¢ Harvest Window

¢ Silage Pit Management

¢ How much water do you have?

=== New Page ===

Corn Silage Favored Because....

¢ Corn Silage is high in energy.
— Grain content AND stover digestibility affect
energy level
¢ It is believed that BMR plant traits enhance
the value of corn silage as a nutrient source

— lower lignin concentration and higher fiber
digestibility than conventional corn silage but.....

¢ If water is not limited, corn silage quality is
relatively consistent.

=== New Page ===

Corn vs. Sorghum Silage
Corn Silage Sorghum Silage

Often the silage of choice

— Nutritional content of corn silage is
generally consistent

— Under water stress, corn silage quality
is reduced

¢ Corn silage quality is dependent on the
amount of grain produced

Higher Yield potential
— 27 to 32 tons/ac
More herbicide options
— Glyphosate and Glufosinate tolerance
— Increased post emergent options
SCA not an issue
Bt Hybrids provide insect protection
— Rootworm and Earworm protection

=== New Page ===

Corn for Silage

1. Corn Planted for Silage

2. Failed Corn

— Hail Damage
— Drought Stress

Important to remember:

POOR QUALITY FORAGE =
POOR QUALITY SILAGE

=== New Page ===

Corn vs. Sorghum Silage

Corn Silage

Sorghum Silage

Significant variability between
sorghum silage hybrids — quality
and yield

Forage sorghums are more
drought tolerant and able to
maintain yield and quality under
moderate water stress

Yield potential
— 20to 27 tons/ac
Cheaper seed cost (~$18/ac for

forage sorghums vs. ~$110/ac
for corn silage)

Limited SCA tolerant sorghum
hybrids on market

¢ Poor ear development

¢ Increased shrinkage in the

=== New Page ===

Improper DM and Shrink

¢ Shrink is important because you do not want to run
out of silage

¢ Shrink results from fermentation and spoilage
losses as well as scale and DM errors at delivery

¢ % Shrink = (Ib delivered — Ib fed)/ lb delivered

Example: 20,000 |b delivered and 16,000 Ib fed
(20,000-16,000)/20,000 = 20% Shrink

You paid for pounds delivered not pounds fed!

=== New Page ===

Drought Damaged
Corn Silage

Poor ear development
Decreased tonnage
Increased shrinkage in the
silage pit due to high DM
Decreased starch and TDN

— Normal corn TDN=90

— Drought damaged corn
TDN reduced by 60%
(Mader et al.)

If there is a risk for drought damaged
corn, consider forage sorghums.

Will the system capacity meet the crop demand?

and you operate at 90% efficiency (depending on
environmental conditions)

To irrigate 120 acres a....

¢ 3 gpm/acre pump capacity = 0.15 in./day or ~1.0 in./week

¢ 5 gom/acre pump capacity = 0.23 in./day or ~1.6 in./week

¢ 7.3 gpm/acre pump capacity = 0.35 in./day or 2.45 in./week

¢ On 120 acres, you need ~ 876 gpm to meet this demand if your
system is 90% efficient!

¢ If system is only 80% efficient, you need ~1000 gpm to meet
this demand on 120 acres!

Quality Forage Sorghum Silage
Begins With Hybrid Selection

1. Not all sorghum equal

— Evaluate variety trials from
multiple locations

2. Hybrid should match
production system and end-
user goals

— Later maturity class hybrids
have greater yield potential, but
do you have the water to meet
the demand?

— Late season hybrids more prone
to lodging under late season
moisture

— Choose hybrid based on hybrid
specific characteristics not
forage type

Purpose)

In addition to hybrid selection,
management is necessary to optimize
sorghum silage quality:

1. Harvest early targeting soft-dough stage
2. Target dry matter at ~30-35%
3. Swath if necessary to obtain the correct moisture

4. Chop length about one-half inch.

5. How is it ensiled?

QUALITY Forage and Water Use

¢Sorghum silage is an alternative to corn silage due to
drought tolerance but to produce comparable
tonnage, you NEED water.

If drought stressed, sorghum will “shut down” at
peak water demand periods.

°If corn is tasseling and you don’t meet the water
demand, you lose quality more quickly with corn
than with sorghum.

*Corn uses more water than forage sorghums, but
seasonal water use will depend on maturity class and
environmental conditions

¢PS forage sorghum will use more water than an
earlier maturing corn hybrid
