Soybean
by Jason Pavel

Soybean Anthracnose, caused by
Colletotrichum truncatum and related species,
occurs worldwide and reduces plant stand, seed
quality, and yield by 16-26% in the United
States. Pod infections have a larger impact on
yield than stem or petiole infections. Soybean
is susceptible to Anthracnose at all stages of
development.

Pre- and post-emergence damping-off occurs
when infected seeds are planted. Dark-brown,
sunken lesions develop on the cotyledons of
emerging seedlings. Under warm humid
conditions, numerous small lesions may Kill
young plants. Irregular brown lesions can
develop at any time on stems, petioles, and
pods. Lesions may girdle petioles and cause
early defoliation, while early infection of the
pods or pedicles can cause seeds to not
develop or cause the seeds to be fewer and
smaller. Lesions at the nodes and at the top of
plants can produce a diagnostic shepherd’s
crook of the stem.

Near soybean maturity, black fungal fruiting
bodies that produce abundant, minute, black
spines (setae) appear in random places on
infected tissue. These spines may be seen with

a good hand lens and can be used to
differentiate Anthracnose from Pod and Stem
Blight caused by Diaporthe phaseolorum
whose fruiting bodies grow in rows and lack
spines.

Control practices to prevent Anthracnose
include use of resistant varieties of soybean,
buying high-quality seed, using disease-free
seed, and tillage or crop rotation practices that
reduce soybean residue. Applying a fungicide
between beginning pod development and initial
seed formation can be effective at suppressing
Anthracnose. Fungicide seed treatments can
also reduce the effects of Anthracnose on
seedlings. Many products are labeled for
control of Soybean Anthracnose, including
Alto, or Aproach, or Aproach Prima, or Domark
230ME, or Evito 480SC, or Folicur 3.6F, or
Fortix, or Gem RC, or Priaxor, or Proline
480SC, or Quadris 2.08SC, or Quadris Top, or
Quadris Xtra, or Quilt, or Quilt Excel, or
Stratego, or Stratego YLD, or Tilt, or Topguard,
or Topsin 4.5FL, or Topsin XTR.

Ash

As many of you have already heard on the
news, the Emerald Ash Borer has been found in
three counties in Arkansas. The Arkansas
Agriculture Department/Arkansas State Plant
Board has verified Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) in
Hot Springs, Clark, and Nevada counties during
their annual survey for the presence of this
insect. The Emerald Ash Borer has killed
millions of trees in 24 states in the U.S. and two
provinces in Canada since its discovery in 2002.
Tree death occurs 3-5 years after initial
infestation. The adult borer is a metallic green
beetle about 1/2" long and 1/8" wide. The
female lays eggs on the bark of ash trees.
When the eggs hatch, the larvae bore into the
bark to the fluid conducting vessels underneath.
The feeding activity of the larvae eventually cuts
off the flow of nutrients to the tree, killing the

tree. There are effective systemic insecticides
for control of EAB. However, by the time most
people notice the symptoms of infestation, the
tree’s vascular system may already be too
compromised to effectively take up the
insecticide. _ Homeowners may use Bayer
Advanced TM Tree & Shrub Insect Control in
early to mid-spring, and Ortho Tree and Shrub
Insect Control Ready to Use Granules® in mid
to late spring.

Report signs of the beetle to the Arkansas
State Plant Board at 501-225-1598.
