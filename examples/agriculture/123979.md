Pomegranate

The pomegranate is not difficult to grow in
warm, dry climates. Below 12°F, injury and
death occur. A pomegranate plant makes a
long-lived, neat, rounded shrub or small tree
that can grow to 20 or 30 ft., but more typically
grows to 12 to 16 ft. in height. They do best in
full sun with well-drained soils and a pH of 5.5-
7.0. A pomegranate plant has few problems
when grown in ideal conditions, but occasionally
gets Cercospora Leaf and Fruit Spot, caused by
Cercospora punicae. Symptoms on fruit are
small, conspicuous, dark-brown spots that are
circular to begin with but become irregular as
they enlarge and coalesce. The lesions on
leaves are circular to angular, dark reddish
brown to nearly black with a diffuse yellow halo,
and from 0.5-5mm_ in diameter. Heavy
infections cause the leaves to turn yellow and
fall prematurely. Good sanitation helps in
control of Cercospora. Fallen leaves should be
raked up, and diseased fruit should be removed.

Buckeye

Buckeye Blotch, caused by the fungus
Guignardia aesculi, is more a_ cosmetic
problem in Horse chestnut and Buckeye trees
than a seriously damaging disease. Reddish-
brown lesions with bright yellow halos enlarge
to blight large portions of the leaves. Leaves
look scorched and become dry, brittle, and
curled and fall prematurely from the tree. Tiny,
pimple-like fruiting bodies of the fungus may be
observed with a hand lens in the blighted
portions of the leaves. Wet conditions
exacerbate the problem, producing multiple
cycles of infection. Control begins at budbreak
as new leaves are starting to emerge. A

fungicide containing chlorothalonil or Mancozeb
may be used, with repeat applications at 10-14-
day intervals. Utilize good cultural practices by
cleaning up all fallen leaves and avoiding
overhead irrigation.

Bald Cypress

The Bald Cypress Gall Midge, Taxodiomyia
cupressiananassa, is a small fly that lays her
eggs on cypress twigs. The eggs hatch, and
the larvae begin feeding on the foliage. This
induces rapid gall formation that encloses the
larvae, protecting them from predators. The
galls are oval shaped, initially pink in color
changing to white, and eventually brown as the
galls age. The overwintering galls are copper
brown. They fall from the tree still attached to
branchlets late in the season. Gall size ranges
from 20mm-3cm (3/4 to 1 3/16 in.). The larger
the gall, the more larvae it contains, with large
galls containing 15 or more larvae. The larvae

pupate inside the overwintering galls and
emerge in the spring as adults. The female
mates and lays an average of 120 brightly
colored, orange, translucent eggs in clusters of
about 15 eggs each during her one-to-two-day
adult life span. Insecticides are generally not
advised due to the difficulty of timing
applications while adults are active. Fallen galls
should be collected in autumn or in early spring
before the midges become active and start
laying eggs. This reduces the number of galls
in a new season.

Grapes and Muscadines

The Grape Berry Moth (GBM), Paralobesia
viteana, is a native moth that can cause
considerable damage to grapes and
muscadines. GBMs overwinter as pupae in
grayish silken cocoons in fallen leaves. The
adults are a small, mottled brown moth. GBM
adults emerge in late spring, about the time
grapes bloom. The females fly at dusk, laying
an average of 20 flat oval eggs singly on grape
stems, blossom clusters, or berries. Eggs
hatch in 4-8 days depending on temperature.
Newly hatched larvae are creamy white with a
dark brown head and thoracic shield. Older
larvae become greenish brown and eventually
purple. The head of the mature larva is light
brown with a dark colored thoracic shield.
Newly hatched larvae feed on tender new
stems, blossom buds, and young berries. At
this stage they feed within protective webbings.
Later, when berries reach about 3mm (1/8 in.)
in diameter, the larvae begin to burrow into
them. The second generation of larvae feed
only on berries. GBM pheromone traps should
be placed into the vineyard interior by May 15.
Spray the perimeter vines in May to early June
if greater than 1% of berry clusters are
damaged by GBMs. Intrepid is a growth
regulator that is effective if applied just before
hatch, and again 10 days later. See MP144 for
additional control information:
