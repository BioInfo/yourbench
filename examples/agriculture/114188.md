How often should we be
monitoring?

Depends on the pest right...

Could be at germination,
every month, every other
week, every week or maybe
even every day!!!

How should we be
monitoring?

¢ In arepresentative manner!!!

¢ Alfalfa we do 5 sweeps in
each quadrant of a field and
take the averages.

¢ Sorghum and corn we take 5
random leaves far enough
from one another and split
field into quadrants once again
to get field scale averages

Crickets and Ground Dwelling Beetles
Field crickets (Gryllus spp.), Darkling Beetles (Blapstinus spp.), Ground Beetles (Carabids) and Rove Beetles (Staphylinids)

Description and Life History: These insects are annual pests in early planted sprinkler-irrigated lettuce fields in the low desert. When they occur, they can quickly
destroy most of a field. Problems are usually in fields planted closely to cotton or Sudangrass in August and September. Moving out of cotton, Sudangrass and
desert flora, large numbers of these pests will migrate to seedling lettuce if available. Most damage occurs at night. They hide during the day in soil cracks, ditches,
weeds, and under irrigation pipes.

Cabbage Looper
Trichoplusia Ni (Hubner)
Description and Life History: The cabbage looper is a very destructive pest on lettuce and will feed on many other crops including cole crops, leafy greens,

melons, tomatoes, and cotton (Fig. 8). Cabbage loopers occur year round in Arizona's central and southwestern desert areas. Populations are especially a problem
in the fall, when newly-planted winter vegetables are emerging.

Figure 8. Cabbage looper larva.

Cabbage looper moths lay single, dome-shaped eggs on the under side of older leaves. A single female may lay 275 to 350 eggs. Eggs will darken as they age, and
will hatch in 2 to 5 days. The larvae are light green in color and have a distinctive white stripe along each side of the body. The larvae have two sets of legs in the
front of the body and three sets of fatter, unjointed prolegs at the rear. They move in a "looping" manner, arching the middle portion of the body as they move
forward. Two to four weeks are required for full development to a 5th instar larva. Cabbage looper pupae appear as greenish to brown pupas wrapped in a delicate
white cocoon of fine threads usually attached to the underside of the leaf. Pupation usually takes 10 to 16 days. The moth is mottled brown in color, and has a small
silvery spot (sometimes a figure 8) near the middle of its front wing. Cabbage loopers may have 3 to 5 generations per year.

Damage: Loopers damage plants by eating ragged holes in leaves, and sometimes working their way into heads. They also cause damage by contaminating
marketable portions with their bodies and frass. High populations can chew seedlings severely enough to kill them or slow growth enough to inhibit uniform maturing
of the crop, but most economic damage occurs after heading. Young plants between thinning and heading can tolerate substantial feeding by loopers and other
caterpillars without loss of yield or quality. Heads contaminated with loopers, or tunneled into by loopers are not marketable.

Management and Control: Monitoring for cabbage looper and other Lepidopterous pests should involve sampling plants twice a week once seedling emergence
begins. When populations appear to be increasing, check more often. Follow the guidelines used for monitoring beet armyworms. On lettuce, monitor for eggs and
larvae of loopers while checking for other caterpillar pests that feed on leaves and heads. Action thresholds are similar to those of beet armyworm: treat seedlings or
small plants when populations of small loopers are large enough to stunt growth. If other Lepidopterous species are present, also include them in this total. Between
thinning and heading, treat if the worm population reaches one larva per 50 plants. During head formation, treat if sample counts exceed one larva per 25 plants.
Cabbage loopers are especially sensitive to B.t.s. Including a B.t. with insecticide applications targeting beet armyworms will usually control any cabbage loopers

present.
