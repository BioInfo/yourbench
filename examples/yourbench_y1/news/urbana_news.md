# Carlinville, Urbana receive grant money for grocery stores

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WAND) â€” Gov. JB Pritzker awarded nearly $8 million in grants Thursday to address food deserts across the state. Two central Illinois communities will benefit from massive investments to build or improve grocery stores.

Pritzker believes grocery stores are the backbone of communities. However, the Democrat knows more than 3 million Illinoisans live in a food desert.

A 2023 law put $20 million towards helping grocery stores stay open and lifting up local governments or independent grocers opening stores.

"Far too many families have difficulty putting food on the table simply because they live a far distance from a grocery store," Pritzker said. "Whether you live in a small town or you live in a dense urban neighborhood, everyone needs local access to quality healthy food options."

Chicago, Peoria, and Rockford received grants to create new grocery stores in food deserts. The Our Market Collaborative in Carlinville plans to use nearly $2.4 million in grant funding to renovate a downtown property and create a new grocery store for the entire Macoupin County community.

"This funding will not only provide our communities with affordable and nutritious food," said Cameron Joost, assistant director for the Illinois Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity. "But it will also help boost our local economies and improve quality of life for thousands of Illinois residents."

Urbana is one of seven communities receiving funding for grocery store equipment upgrades. The Common Good Food Co-op could use over $81,400 to buy new energy-efficient meat, produce and dairy coolers and three rooftop condenser units.
