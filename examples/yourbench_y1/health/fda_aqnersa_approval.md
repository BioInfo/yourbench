3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
For oral suspension: 1 gram levacetylleucine as white to off-white strawberry flavored granules in a
unit-dose packet.
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
None.
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, AQNEURSA may cause embryo-fetal harm when
administered during pregnancy. Administration of levacetylleucine to pregnant rats and rabbits during
the period of organogenesis caused an increase in embryo-fetal death (post implantation
loss/resorption) and skeletal malformations at a dose that was approximately 1.4-fold and 6-fold,
respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 4 g/day of levacetylleucine (based
on body surface area).

Reference ID: 5451543

The decision to continue or discontinue AQNEURSA treatment during pregnancy should consider the
female’s need for AQNEURSA, the potential drug-related risks to the fetus, and the potential adverse
outcomes from untreated maternal disease.
For females of reproductive potential, verify that the patient is not pregnant prior to initiating treatment
with AQNEURSA. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during
treatment with AQNEURSA and for 7 days after the last dose if AQNEURSA is discontinued [see Use
in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
6.1 Clinical Trial Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates
observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of
another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
The safety of AQNEURSA was evaluated in Trial 1, which included a total of 60 patients with
Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NPC), in a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial [see
Clinical Studies (14)]. The mean (SD) treatment duration of AQNEURSA was 86.2 (4.7) days (69 min,
97 max); the mean (SD) treatment duration on placebo was 87.3 (4.8) days (78 min, 113 max).
Table 2 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in patients who were treated with AQNEURSA
in Treatment Period I of Trial 1.

Period 1, all of whom were receiving miglustat for 42 days or longer at the time of enrollment. In two

Reference ID: 5451543

of these patients, the thrombocytopenia was present at baseline. In the other two patients, the
thrombocytopenia developed during the trial.
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on AQNEURSA
N-acetyl-DL-leucine and N-acetyl-D-leucine
Avoid concomitant use of AQNEURSA with N-acetyl-DL-leucine and N-acetyl-D-leucine.
The D-enantiomer, N-acetyl-D-leucine, competes with levacetylleucine for monocarboxylate
transporter uptake, which may reduce the levacetylleucine efficacy.
7.2 Effect of AQNEURSA on Other Drugs
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Transporter Substrates
Monitor more frequently for P-gp substrate related adverse reactions when used concomitantly with
AQNEURSA.
Levacetylleucine inhibits P-gp [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, the clinical significance
of this finding has not been fully characterized.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Risk Summary
Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, AQNEURSA may cause embryo-fetal harm when
administered during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, an increase in embryo-fetal death
(post implantation loss/resorption), decrease in fetal body weight, and increase in external and
skeletal malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when levacetylleucine was administered in
pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. These effects were observed in rats
and rabbits at the doses that were approximately 1.4-fold and 6-fold, respectively, the maximum
recommended human dose (MRHD) in patients taking 4 grams of AQNEURSA per day (see Data).
There are no available data on AQNEURSA use in pregnant females to evaluate a drug-associated
risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Advise a
pregnant female of the potential risk to the fetus. The decision to continue or discontinue AQNEURSA
treatment during pregnancy should consider the female’s need for AQNEURSA, the potential drugrelated risks to the fetus, and the potential adverse outcomes from untreated maternal disease.
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, miscarriage, or other adverse outcomes. In
the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in
clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.
Data
Animal Data
In a dose-range finding rat embryo-fetal development study, doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day oral
levacetylleucine were administered daily to pregnant females during organogenesis (Gestation Day

Reference ID: 5451543

[GD] 6 through GD 17). Increases in the mean number of resorptions, mean post-implantation losses
and skeletal malformations (thoracic arch of the vertebra-fused thoracic arch, misaligned thoracic
arch, hemicentric thoracic centrum, and misaligned thoracic centrum; vertebral column-scoliosis, and
ribs-absent costal cartilage and short rib) were observed at a dose of 600 mg/kg/day, which is 1.4-fold
the 4 g/day MRHD of levacetylleucine based on body surface area.
In a dose-range finding rabbit embryo-fetal development study, doses of up to 2500 mg/kg/day oral
levacetylleucine were administered daily to pregnant females during organogenesis (GD 7 through
GD 19). Increased embryo-fetal death (post-implantation loss/resorption), decreased fetal body
weight, and increase in external (open or partially open eyes, hyperflexion of limbs) and skeletal
malformations (misshapen maxillae and premaxillae, and small interparietal bones) were observed at
the dose of 1250 mg/kg/day, which is 6-fold the MRHD of levacetylleucine based on body surface
area.
8.2 Lactation
Risk Summary
There are no data on the presence of levacetylleucine or its metabolites in either human or animal
milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and
health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for
AQNEURSA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from levacetylleucine or from
the underlying maternal condition.
8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
AQNEURSA may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Use in
Specific Populations (8.1)].
Pregnancy Testing
For a female of reproductive potential, verify that the patient is not pregnant prior to initiating
treatment with AQNEURSA.
Contraception
Females
Advise a female of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for
7 days after the last dose if AQNEURSA is discontinued.
8.4 Pediatric Use
The safety and effectiveness of AQNEURSA for the treatment of NPC have been established in 23
pediatric patients weighing ≥15 kg in Trial 1. Use of AQNEURSA for this indication is supported by
evidence from one adequate and well-controlled study in adults and pediatric patients weighing
≥15 kg with additional pharmacokinetic data from 40 adults and 17 pediatric patients who participated
in two open-label studies [see Clinical Studies (14) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The safety and
effectiveness of AQNEURSA have not been established in pediatric patients weighing <15 kg.
8.5 Geriatric Use

Reference ID: 5451543

NPC is largely a disease of pediatric and young adult patients. Clinical studies of AQNEURSA did not
include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond
differently from younger adult patients.
11 DESCRIPTION
AQNEURSA (levacetylleucine) for oral suspension contains the drug substance levacetylleucine, a
modified amino acid. Levacetylleucine is slightly soluble in aqueous solutions. The chemical name is
2-acetamido-4-methylpentanoic acid. The empirical formula is C8H15NO3 and the molecular weight is
173.21. The chemical structure is:

Each packet of AQNEURSA granules contains 1 gram levacetylleucine and the inactive ingredients
hypromellose, isomalt and strawberry flavor.
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
The distinct molecular target for levacetylleucine in the treatment of NPC is unknown.
12.2 Pharmacodynamics
Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for levacetylleucine.
A relationship was not observed between increasing levacetylleucine exposure and clinical efficacy.
The time course of pharmacodynamic response is unknown.
12.3 Pharmacokinetics
Levacetylleucine pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state are presented as mean (SD) unless
otherwise specified. Levacetylleucine maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve from
time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24hrs) were 8.3 (3.3) µg/mL and 33.2 (12.5) h*μg/mL.
No levacetylleucine accumulation occurs after repeated administration.
Absorption

Reference ID: 5451543

Levacetylleucine time to Cmax (Tmax) is 1 hour (ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 hours).
Distribution
Levacetylleucine apparent (oral) volume of distribution (Vss/F) is 253 (125) L.
Elimination
Levacetylleucine estimated half-life is around 1 hour and the apparent (oral) clearance is
139 (59) L/h.
Metabolism
Levacetylleucine is metabolized into acetate and L-leucine by ubiquitously expressed enzymes, which
are used endogenously in catabolic and metabolic pathways. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are not
involved in the metabolism of levacetylleucine.
Specific Populations
No clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetics of levacetylleucine were observed based on
age (range 5 to 67 years), gender (female 45.5%, male 54.5%), or race/ethnicity (White 91%, Asian
4%, Other or not specified 5%). The effect of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, or pregnancy on
levacetylleucine pharmacokinetics is unknown.
Body Weight
The volume of distribution and clearance of levacetylleucine increases with increasing body weight
(20.5 kg to 98.4 kg), but these effects on pharmacokinetics are minimized by the recommended
weight-based dosing.
Drug Interaction Studies
In Vitro Studies
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes: Levacetylleucine does not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9,
2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and does not induce CYP 1A2, 2B6, and or 3A4.
Transporter Systems
Levacetylleucine is a substrate of organic anion transporter (OAT)1 and OAT3, but not organic cation
transporter (OCT)2, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), or P-glycoprotein (P-gp).
Levacetylleucine inhibits P-gp, BCRP, bile salt export pump (BSEP), OAT1 and OAT3, but does not
inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3.
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
Carcinogenesis
Animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of levacetylleucine have not been conducted.
Mutagenesis
Levacetylleucine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including
bacterial reverse mutation (Ames), chromosomal aberration (in human lymphocytes) and mouse
micronucleus assays.

Reference ID: 5451543

Impairment of Fertility
Animal studies to evaluate effects of levacetylleucine on fertility have not been conducted.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
The safety and efficacy of AQNEURSA for the treatment of NPC were evaluated in a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study (NCT05163288) that evaluated the
efficacy of AQNEURSA in 60 patients. To be eligible for the study, patients had to be aged 4 years or
older with a confirmed diagnosis of NPC. Patients were required to have at least mild disease-related
neurological symptoms.
Patients were assessed over a 2-week baseline period. Patients were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio
to one of the two treatment sequences:
• Treatment Sequence 1 (N=30): AQNEURSA in Treatment Period I, followed by immediate
crossover to placebo in Treatment Period II
• Treatment Sequence 2 (N=30): placebo in Treatment Period I, followed by immediate
crossover to AQNEURSA in Treatment Period II.
AQNEURSA and placebo were administered orally with or without food for 12 weeks in each period.
Patients aged ≥13 years received 4 gram per day (as 2 gram morning dose, 1 gram afternoon dose,
and 1 gram evening dose). The AQNEURSA dosage in pediatric patients under 13 years was based
on patient’s body weight [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The approved dosage regimen is
based on body weight and not age. Fifty-nine patients (98%) completed the study and received both
placebo and AQNEURSA. One patient withdrew based on healthcare provider decision during
AQNEURSA treatment.
Of the 60 randomized patients (37 adults and 23 pediatric patients), 27 were female and 33 were
male. The median age at treatment initiation was 25 years (range: 5 to 67 years). 90% of the patients
were White, 3% Asian, and 7% Other. The majority of the patients (n=51, 85%) received miglustat
treatment prior to randomization and during the trial.
The primary efficacy outcome was assessed using a modified version of the Scale for Assessment
and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), referred to as the functional SARA (fSARA). The SARA is a clinical
assessment tool that assesses gait, stability, speech, and upper and lower limb coordination across 8
individual domains. The fSARA consists only of gait, sitting, stance, and speech disturbance domains
of the original SARA with modifications to the scoring responses. Each domain was rescored from 0
to 4, where 0 is the best neurological status and 4 the worst, with a total score ranging from 0 to 16.
The fSARA score was assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks (the end of Period I), 18 weeks, and
24 weeks (the end of Period II). The estimated mean fSARA total score was 5.1 when patients were
treated with AQNEURSA and 5.6 when patients were treated with placebo. The estimated treatment
difference for the fSARA total score was -0.4 (95% CI: -0.7, -0.2) (Table 3).
