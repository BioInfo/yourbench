# U.S. Department of Energy Announces Nearly $44 Million for Clean Energy Planning and Deployment on Tribal Lands

$18.8 Million Awarded to Six American Indian and Alaska Native Communities to Install Cost-Saving, Clean Energy Infrastructure with an Additional $25 Million in Funding Available for Future Planning and Development Projects on Tribal Lands

WASHINGTON, D.C.—The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced today nearly $44 million for Tribal communities to deploy clean energy solutions that will bring energy security and resilience and help lower energy costs. Six American Indian and Alaska Native communities located in five states will receive $18.8 million in funding to install solar and wind energy infrastructure which will provide 5.6-megawatts (MW) of clean energy generation and battery storage for over 100 Tribal buildings. An additional $25 million in funding will be made available through a new funding opportunity announcement for Tribal communities to plan, assess, and develop clean energy projects. These investments bring our nation closer to the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal to enhance Tribal energy sovereignty, while achieving an equitable clean energy future.    

 

“Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the DOE has provided historic funding for Tribal communities and today’s announcement doubles down on our commitments to ensuring these communities remain in the driver’s seat as together we deploy clean, stable and affordable power to those that need it most,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “Tribal Nations are helping to lead the way as we transition to build more cost-effective, stronger, and resilient communities for the future.”    

 

The six cost-shared energy projects selected today are the result of a competitive funding opportunity announcement released Feb. 27, 2024. Through these grants, the DOE Office of Indian Energy will continue its efforts to advance Tribal energy sovereignty and maximize the deployment of clean, reliable, affordable, and local energy solutions. Collectively, these projects are estimated to result in nearly 5.6-MW of clean energy generation and over 3.2-megawatt-hours (MWh) of battery storage, impacting over 100 Tribal buildings and saving those communities nearly $54 million over the life of those systems. These investments will yield tangible results year after year to improve the quality of life for these underserved communities.  

 

The projects competitively selected for negotiation of award, in alphabetical order, are: 

 

Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians in Palm Springs, CA, will install a cumulative of 551-kilowatts (kW) of solar photovoltaics (PV) and a 1,311-kilowatt-hour (kWh) battery energy storage system (BESS) on five essential buildings, significantly enhancing grid resiliency, reducing energy costs, and promoting environmental sustainability. It is estimated that the systems will save the Tribe $9.3 million over the life of the systems. (Award amount: $4,376,448)  
Alaska Village Electric Cooperative, Inc. will refurbish two 200-kW wind turbines and install a BESS, with a power capacity of 320-kW and storage capacity of 540-kWh in Mekoryuk, AK. The projects will reduce power costs and diesel fuel use, increase wind-generated power by 94%, displace 41,360 gallons of diesel fuel, reduce diesel generator operations by 3,830 hours per year, convert excess wind generation to heat (offsetting 1,900 gallons of heating oil annually), and is estimated to save over $4.7 million over the life of the systems. (Award amount: $2,205,332)  
Barona Group of the Capitan Grande Band of Mission Indians in Lakeside, CA, will install 2,300-kW of ground-mounted solar PV systems to serve four vital facilities. The project’s new PV capacity is expected to generate 5,686-MWh of electricity in Year 1 to reduce the Band’s dependence on grid-supplied energy, reducing the Tribe’s electric bills by more than $31.2 million over the project’s 25-year lifetime. (Award amount: $5,000,000)  
Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community, Prior Lake, MN, will deploy five solar PV systems, totaling approximately 596-kW, on the rooftops of existing buildings in Prior Lake, MN. The systems will offset approximately 11% of the total energy usage of the five critical buildings and support the Tribe’s long-term vision of being carbon-neutral by avoiding approximately 28,119,128 lbs. of carbon dioxide emissions over the life of the systems. (Award amount: $1,258,799)  
United Tribes Technical College, Bismark, ND, will install 150-kW of solar PV and a 250-kW/1,376-kWh BESS at the Lewis Goodhouse Wellness Center, an essential Tribal building and emergency sheltering area on the campus of United Tribes Technical College. The system is expected to meet 42% of the average annual energy consumption; allow the College to establish a revolving fund with the savings to be used for operations and maintenance; and support additional investments in clean energy deployment, education, and training. (Award amount: $2,198,863) 
Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, Anadarko, OK, will install 1,200-kW of solar PV to meet 36% of the energy load of high-energy-consuming buildings in Hinton, OK, saving the Tribe an estimated $170,000 annually and reducing its carbon footprint by 33,047 metric tons per year. As a step toward the Tribe's long-term vision of achieving energy self-sufficiency and sustainability, the project is also expected to provide 10 temporary construction jobs and 2 long-term positions. (Award amount: $3,795,312)  
 

Through a new $25 million funding opportunity announcement, the DOE Office of Indian Energy anticipates making approximately 20–40 awards that range from $100,000 to $2,500,000 for projects that support the planning, assessment, and development of clean energy for Tribal buildings or on Tribal lands.  

 

Applications are due at 5 p.m. ET on Jan. 23, 2025. To learn more, join an informational webinar on Oct. 24, 2024.
