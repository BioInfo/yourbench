Consumer Information
Rivian’s Consumer Assistance Process
Rivian is dedicated to achieving the highest level of consumer satisfaction. Rivian is in the best position to help
you with your service and repair needs. To obtain warranty service, contact Rivian Customer Service.
Rivian will then communicate with you to:
1. Determine the optimal repair, service, or both for the vehicle and if the repair or service is covered under
warranty.
2. Determine the most convenient repair and service location, date, and time.
3. Provide an estimated duration of repair and service.
Rivian will offer you alternative transportation for the duration of the warranty repair free of charge for certain
repair lengths. When Rivian notifies you that vehicle repairs, service, or both, have been completed, you are
responsible for picking up the vehicle in a timely manner. If you cannot pick up the vehicle in a timely manner,
you are responsible for coordinating with the Rivian Service Center. Failure to do so will result in additional
charges not covered under warranty. Typical charges could include storage and vehicle rental fees. Local or
state authorities may require taxes be paid for warranty repairs and services. Rivian is not responsible for any
taxes on warranty repair and warranty services.

Alternative Dispute Resolution
BBB AUTO LINE Alternative Dispute Resolution Program
Rivian’s internal consumer assistance program will make every effort to resolve every customer concern in a
satisfactory manner. We realize, however, that mutual agreement on some issues may not be possible. To
ensure that you have had an opportunity to have your concern fully reviewed, Rivian provides an Alternative
Dispute Resolution (non-binding arbitration) program. Rivian offers the program through:
BBB AUTO LINE
1676 International Drive, Suite 550
McLean, VA 22102
United States
The BBB AUTO LINE program is available free of charge, and is part of Rivian’s effort to provide you with an
impartial third-party organization to equitably resolve your concerns. To request that your case be reviewed
through the program, please contact BBB AUTO LINE at (800) 955-5100 or obtain a copy of a claim form at
https://auto.bbbnp.org/lemon-law-complaint-form/. You may also call Rivian at 888-RIVIAN1 / (888) 748-4261
to obtain a copy of the form. When you contact Rivian or BBB AUTO LINE, have your vehicle identification
number and the current mileage on your Rivian vehicle. BBB AUTO LINE may also request that you provide
your name and address, as well as a description of the problem with your vehicle. You should also include a
copy of your correspondence with Rivian related to the issue with your Rivian vehicle. BBB AUTO LINE may
only resolve disputes between you and Rivian on an individual basis and not on a class or representative action.
BBB AUTO LINE generally attempts to reach a decision on any claim within 40 days of when the claim is
opened. The Scope of BBB AUTO LINE’s decision shall be limited and excludes from consideration any
decision of punitive damages, attorney’s fees, or consequential damages (other than incidental damages
expressly permitted by applicable law).
BBB AUTO LINE’s decision is binding on Rivian, but not on you. If you accept the decision, Rivian will comply
within 30 days after notice of your acceptance.
If you are not satisfied with the arbitrator’s decision or Rivian’s compliance, you may pursue your claim in
binding arbitration on an individual basis in accordance with your Final Agreement to Purchase. Your
participation in the BBB AUTO LINE Program will satisfy the Initial Dispute Resolution Requirement in the Final
Agreement to Purchase. Even if rejected, the BBB arbitrator’s decision and any related findings will be
admissible in any subsequent actions.
NOTE
The BBB AUTO LINE alternative dispute resolution process referenced above is a separate procedure from
the Binding Arbitration program referenced below.
California Civil Code Section 1793.2(d) requires that if Rivian or its representative is unable to repair a new
motor vehicle to conform to the vehicle’s applicable express warranty after a reasonable number of attempts,
Rivian may be required under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, to replace or repurchase the vehicle.
California Civil Code Section 1793.22(b) creates a presumption that Rivian has had a reasonable number of
attempts to conform the vehicle to its applicable express warranties if, within 18 months from delivery to the
buyer or 18,000 miles on the vehicle’s odometer, whichever occurs first. The presumption in 1793.22(b) may not
be asserted by the buyer until after the buyer has initially resorted to the BBB AUTO LINE.

Alternative Dispute Resolution
Binding Arbitration
You may resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Rivian arising out of, or related to, your
New Vehicle Limited Warranty by binding arbitration on an individual basis as the sole means to resolve claims
as and to the extent provided in the Applicable Law and Class Action Waiver section of your Final Agreement
to Purchase and reproduced in this Warranty Guide.
Please note, however, that regardless of where you reside or where your vehicle is registered, your vehicle was
purchased in a state where Rivian is licensed to sell new motor vehicles and the laws of the state where the
vehicle was purchased may govern in certain situations.
Dispute Resolution – Arbitration, Class Waiver
Any claim or dispute you may have related to your New Vehicle Limited Warranty or the duties contemplated
under the warranty (among other disputes) will be arbitrated pursuant to the terms of the Final Agreement to
Purchase. Under that agreement, you agreed to resolve disputes with Rivian by binding arbitration, rather than
litigation in court. Please reference your Final Agreement to Purchase for full details. If you prefer not to submit
your dispute to the BBB Auto Line Program described above, you may proceed, after undertaking reasonable
and good faith efforts to settle the dispute directly, to binding arbitration or small claims court under the Final
Agreement to Purchase.
For your convenience, the relevant portion of the Final Agreement to Purchase is reproduced below:
16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION—ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION WAIVER
Binding Arbitration. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except for small claims or if you
choose to opt-out as provided below, this Section governs all Disputes between you and Rivian. The term
“Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and means any dispute,
demand, claim, or controversy of any kind between you and Rivian, whether based in contract, tort,
statute, or otherwise, including but not limited to any claim for fraud, false advertising, misrepresentation,
strict products liability, negligence, breach of contract, breach of express or implied warranties, or
violations of consumer protection, privacy or data security laws, that arises out of or in any way relates to
(1) this Agreement; (2) our relationship (including any such relationship with affiliate third parties who did
not sign this Agreement); (3) the purchase, sale, condition, design, or manufacturing of the Vehicle; (4)
Rivian products or services; (5) advertising and other communications between you and Rivian; and as
applicable, (6) your credit application. You and Rivian agree to resolve all Disputes by binding
arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA
Consumer Arbitration Rules, unless you and we agree otherwise. For more information on arbitration
and to access the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, please visit: www.adr.org. If the AAA Consumer
Arbitration Rules conflict with this Agreement, then this Agreement shall control. You and we
understand that we are both waiving our rights to go to court (other than small claims court, as
provided below), to present our claims to a jury and to have claims resolved by a jury trial, and also
that judicial appeal rights, if any, are more limited in arbitration than they would be in court.
RIVIAN

Alternative Dispute Resolution
Confidentiality. Arbitrations conducted under this Section shall be kept strictly confidential. Neither you
or Rivian may disclose the fact that an arbitration exists or is proceeding, the nature or content of the
Dispute(s), all documents exchanged in connection with the arbitration, all testimony (including
transcripts of testimony, if any) that is given in the arbitration proceeding, or the results of any arbitration
award. This paragraph shall not prevent disclosure of the arbitration proceedings: (1) as may be required
by law or court order; (2) as may be required to judicially challenge or enforce an arbitration award; (3) as
may be required to assist your or Rivian’s legal counsel, financial advisors, or accountants—provided that
such individuals are also bound by this Section; (4) as may be required to disclose to existing or future
shareholders, existing or potential insurers or reinsurers, existing or potential investors, existing or
potential lenders, or existing or potential purchasers; or (5) if you and Rivian provide prior written
consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this paragraph shall not apply to claims where
confidentiality clauses are made illegal under state or federal law. The arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to
hear any disputes over a breach of this Section and shall have authority to fashion an appropriate remedy.
The arbitrator shall retain jurisdiction to enforce this Section after arbitration has ended.
Initial Dispute Resolution Requirement. Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration or
small claims court. For any Dispute, you and we agree that before taking any formal action to initiate
arbitration or a small claims suit we will contact the other in an attempt to resolve the Dispute. You will
contact us at demands@rivian.com and provide a brief, written description of the Dispute and your
contact information (including your Rivian ID, if you have one). We will contact you at your contact
information on file with Rivian. You and Rivian agree to use reasonable efforts to settle any Dispute
directly and good faith negotiations shall be a pre-condition to either party initiating a small claims suit or
arbitration.
Filing a Demand for Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of 60
days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision
above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, you must file an
arbitration demand with AAA. You can find information about AAA and file your arbitration demand at
https://www.adr.org/Support. You are also required to send a copy of the arbitration demand to us and
you should send it by email to: arbitration@rivian.com.
Fees & Costs. AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will govern the allocation of arbitration fees and costs
between you and Rivian. However, if your arbitration case filing fee exceeds the filing fee you would pay
to file the action in a court of law, Rivian will pay the amount of your case filing fee in excess of the filing
fee you would pay in a court of law. The amount we pay may be reimbursed in whole or in part by decision
of the arbitrator if s/he finds that applicable law allows such reimbursement because your claims were
frivolous or brought in bad faith. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless applicable law
provides otherwise.
Arbitration Location & Procedure. Arbitration shall be initiated and take place in the city or county of
your residence unless you and Rivian agree otherwise, or, if you reside outside of the United States, in
Orange County, California. If your claim does not exceed $25,000, then the arbitration will be conducted
solely on the basis of documents you and Rivian submit to the arbitrator. If your claim exceeds $25,000,
you and Rivian may agree to conduct arbitration by videoconference or teleconference or conduct a
document-only arbitration without any hearing. The arbitrator will have discretion to require a telephonic
or face-to-face hearing for any claim upon the request of a party.
RIVIAN

Alternative Dispute Resolution
Applicable Law. You and Rivian agree that both the substantive and procedural provisions of the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), shall govern the subject matter, formation, procedure, and
enforcement of this Section. The statute of limitations laws, including statutes of repose, of the State in
which the selling Rivian dealership on the first page of this Agreement is located, without regard to choice
or conflict of law principles, will apply to any claims brought in arbitration.
Arbitrator’s Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have
exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability,
enforceability, or formation of this Section, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this
Section is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to resolve all threshold
issues of arbitrability, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration, issues relating to whether this
Section is applicable, unconscionable, or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay,
laches, or estoppel. However, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action
waiver below must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the
validity of the waiver. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available to
you in your individual capacity in a court under law or in equity, including public injunctive relief. The
arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on you and Rivian. To preserve the confidentiality
of the arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator’s award shall not be entered as judgment in a court of law,
unless you or Rivian fail to voluntarily satisfy the arbitration award within sixty (60) days after the
arbitration award has been rendered.
Class Action Waiver. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in each party’s
respective individual capacity only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the
parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND RIVIAN
AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN YOUR OR
ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NEITHER YOU NOR RIVIAN WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR
CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CONSUMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR
OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. If a court (after exhaustion of all appeals) declares any of
this Class Action Waiver unenforceable, then all other aspects of the case must be arbitrated first. After
completing arbitration, the remaining (non-arbitrable) aspects of the case will then be decided by a court.
Small Claims Court. Subject to the Initial Dispute Resolution Requirement, either party may bring an
individual action in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional limits that apply to that forum.
Opt-Out Right. You may opt-out of this Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver within
30 days from the date you electronically sign this Agreement, by sending an email to optout@rivian.com
from the email associated with your Rivian ID with “Opt-Out of Arbitration” in the subject line and, in the
body of the email, your full name and address. Any opt-out of this provision does not affect the validity of
any other arbitration agreement between you and Rivian. If you opt out of this provision and at the time
you sign this Agreement you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate disputes with Rivian, that
existing arbitration agreement will remain in full force and effect.
Severability. If any arbitrator or court determines that any part of this Dispute Resolution – Arbitration
and Class Action Waiver is illegal or unenforceable, then such part will be eliminated and the remainder of
the Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver will remain in force and effect and the
unenforceable part shall be deemed to be modified solely to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
RIVIAN

Alternative Dispute Resolution
Survival. This Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Class Action Waiver shall survive the end of this
Agreement and/or your relationship with Rivian, including the end of any promotion or contest, opt-out of
communication or other use or participation in any Rivian Product or Service.

General Warranty Provisions and
Terms
Warrantor
Rivian Automotive, LLC (“Rivian”) will provide repairs to Rivian passenger vehicles during the applicable
warranty period in accordance with the terms, conditions, and limitations defined in this Warranty Guide.

Limitations and Disclaimers
Limitations and Disclaimers
The warranties in this Warranty Guide are the only express warranties made in connection with Rivian
passenger vehicles.
Warranties and conditions arising under state and federal law including but not limited to implied
warranties and conditions of sale, durability, or those otherwise arising in the course of dealing or usage
of trade, shall be limited in duration to the fullest extent allowable by law, or limited in duration to the term
of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty for such jurisdictions which do not allow a limitation on the duration.
These stated warranties give you specific legal rights. You may have other rights, which vary from state to
state depending on applicable state law. INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF TIME, INCONVENIENCE, LOSS OF USE OF THE VEHICLE, OR
COMMERCIAL LOSS ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS WARRANTY.
In the United States, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (15 U.S.C.A. § 2301 et seq.) (“MMWA”) is the
federal law which governs your New Vehicle Limited Warranty. You must use BBB Auto Line before
seeking remedies via a civil action under the MMWA. However, if you choose to seek remedies that are
not created by the MMWA, you are not required to use BBB Auto Line, although that option is still
available to you. Many states have enacted laws, commonly called ‘Lemon Laws,’ that provide you with
certain rights if you have problems with your new vehicle. These laws vary across state or territory. Some
jurisdictions require your use of BBB Auto Line before pursuing a civil action. Some jurisdictions require
that you provide Rivian with a final repair opportunity. To the fullest extent allowed by the law of your
jurisdiction, you must provide Rivian, during the applicable warranty period specified in this Warranty
Guide, with written notification of any defects you have experienced within a reasonable period-of-time to
allow Rivian an opportunity to make any needed repairs, before you pursue any remedies via a civil
action.

parts or systems is governed by the terms in the applicable warranty section, and other general provisions in
the Warranty Guide section below.
Some states may not allow limitations on implied warranties or the conditions above, in which case, the above
limitations may not apply to you. The replacement part may be a new, reconditioned, or remanufactured part.
Rivian does not authorize any person or entity to create any other obligations or liability for Rivian in
connection with this Warranty Guide. The decision whether to repair or replace a part is reserved for Rivian at
Rivian’s sole discretion.
Your Rights Under State Law
The provisions in this Warranty Guide give you specific legal rights. You may also have other rights that vary by
state.

determine whether any warranty coverages have been voided.
Warranty Period
The New Vehicle Limited Warranty begins on the day a new vehicle is delivered to the first retail purchaser(s)
or by leasing or registering the vehicle for operation, whichever is earlier, and provides coverage for the period
based on the specified warranty. Parts repaired or replaced under this warranty are covered only until the
original warranty period ends or as otherwise provided by applicable law.

New Vehicle Limited Warranty
Battery Pack Limited Warranty
Coverage includes all of the components inside the high-voltage battery pack enclosure and the enclosure.
Interfaces that connect the vehicle systems to the battery (including but not limited to external cables,
harnesses, and hoses) are covered under the terms of the comprehensive warranty.
The high-voltage battery pack capacity naturally decreases over time with use. This expected gradual capacity
loss over time is not covered under the Battery Pack Limited Warranty. However, greater than expected
degradation is covered under the Battery Pack Limited Warranty. The warranty will cover a battery pack that
loses 30% or more of its normal minimum usable rated capacity within the warranty period. Valid battery pack
capacity-related warranty claims will be replaced with a battery pack of equal or greater performance that is
appropriate to the mileage and age of the vehicle and will be covered for the remainder of the warranty period
of the original battery pack. An authorized Rivian service location will determine the usable capacity of your
battery pack to determine if the degradation level is within the expected natural range. The decision to repair,
replace, or provide remanufactured parts, along with the condition of the replacement part, is at the sole
discretion of Rivian.
Drivetrain Limited Warranty
Coverage includes the electric motors, gearbox assembly, disconnects (rear only), and the dual power inverter
module. Interfaces that connect the vehicle systems to the drivetrain (including but not limited to external
cables, harnesses, and hoses) are covered under the terms of the comprehensive warranty.
Corrosion (Perforation Only) Limited Warranty
Coverage begins on the same date as the New Vehicle Limited Warranty and continues for 8 years with no
mileage limit. Rivian will repair or replace any original body panel that rusts completely through from the inside
out (perforated by corrosion). This includes panels previously repaired or replaced under this warranty. You
will not be charged for any parts, material, or labor under this warranty. Any body panels repaired or replaced
under this warranty are covered only for the time remaining in the 8-year warranty period.
Occupant Active Restraint System Limited Warranty
Rivian passenger vehicle seat belts and related seat belt components are warranted against defects that Rivian
finds in workmanship and materials for 8 years or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first. This limited warranty
covers the repair or replacement necessary to correct defects in materials or workmanship of any parts
manufactured or supplied by Rivian that occur under normal operation and use during the applicable coverage
period.
For vehicles sold and registered in the State of Kansas, seat belts and related seat belt components are
warranted against defects in workmanship and materials for 10 years, regardless of mileage.
This limited warranty does not cover replacement of seat belts and related components required as the result
of a collision.

15

New Vehicle Limited Warranty
Adjustment Warranty
Adjustments required due to a defect in material or factory workmanship are covered for the first year or
12,000 miles, whichever comes first. Thereafter, all adjustments are considered owner responsibility. Coverage
includes wheel alignments and tire balancing; brake pad/lining replacements; the replacement of defective
consumable maintenance items (such as wiper blades, key fob batteries, and filters); body fit concerns (such as
misaligned body panels or squeaky hinges); and minor cosmetic imperfections visible at delivery (such as
minor paint imperfections).
Exceptions
The items below are covered for periods different from the comprehensive warranty coverage. These limited
warranties cover the repair or replacement necessary to correct defects in materials or workmanship of any
parts manufactured or supplied by Rivian that occur under normal operation and use during the applicable
coverage period.
l
The original equipment 12-volt batteries that come with your Rivian are covered by a 3-year or 36,000-mile
(whichever occurs first) limited warranty. Defective batteries will be replaced at no cost during this warranty
period. 12-volt batteries may be damaged or drained if the vehicle is left unplugged for an extended time.
12-volt batteries damaged or drained due to such improper maintenance are not covered under warranty.
l
Exterior body panel surface rust is covered by a 3-year or 36,000-mile (whichever occurs first) limited
warranty.
l The Camp Speaker, if equipped, is covered by a 2-year limited warranty.
Exclusions and Limitations

Owner's Guide for your Rivian vehicle for information on service and maintenance requirements.

caused by unauthorized parts and accessories and by their installation, including but not limited to,
driveline failures occurring from modifying the stock vehicle with large tires, wheel spacers, aftermarket
components that can damage the driveline like tank tracks, large off-set wheels.
l
Certain individual items associated with the vehicle, including but not limited to, the tires, external
recharging equipment, or related non-vehicle components that have separate warranties subject to their
own terms and conditions.

New Vehicle Limited Warranty
l
Regular maintenance services, including but not limited to the following:
l
Standard periodic service and diagnostic checks (for details see the Owner’s Guide for your vehicle or
service documents).
l Wheel alignment, balancing, and tire rotation.
l
Exterior and interior care (such as washing, cleaning, and waxing). If equipped, wood trim has inherent
variations in color and texture, dependent upon being properly cleaned and maintained. Wood trim may
lighten or darken due to age or exposure to sunlight; this is not a defect in materials or workmanship.
l
Wearable maintenance items considered to be consumable (such as wiper blades, brake components
including pads and rotors, key fob batteries, and filters).
l
Towing costs, charges, or other fees associated with non-warranty repairs and service (such as failure to
adequately charge the vehicle resulting in loss of motive power during use).
Additional Exclusions and Limitations for Corrosion
The Corrosion (Perforation Only) Limited Warranty does not cover the following:
l
Surface rust on the underbody or any other part of the vehicle except body panels.
l
Rusting of body panels that were repaired, replaced, or refinished after sale of the new vehicle, unless those
panels were repaired or replaced under this warranty.
l Body panel rust caused by abuse, misuse, or lack of maintenance.
l Rusting where the paint has been damaged by road hazards, such as stones and debris.
l
Rust caused by immersion of the body panel in water, mud, or sand, or from exposure to corrosive gas or
industrial fallout.
l
Paint matching. Rivian will decide how much of the repaired or replaced panel (and any adjoining body
panels) needs to be repainted to match the original finish. Rivian will not, under any circumstance, authorize
painting the entire vehicle purely for the purpose of paint matching.
l
Vehicle’s matte finish appearance (if equipped). Maintaining the matte finish is solely the responsibility of
the vehicle owner as described in the Owner's Guide for your vehicle.
l Repairs due to damage caused by application of aftermarket rustproofing products.

New Vehicle Limited Warranty
Voided Warranty
Complying with the Owner's Guide, this Warranty Guide, and any future field service action notifications for
your vehicle is important to maintain warranty coverage. This New Vehicle Limited Warranty may be voided if
the instructions in those documents, or possible future field service actions, are not followed. These
instructions include, but are not limited to, compliance with field service action notifications, vehicle proper
use, vehicle repair and maintenance requirements, and software updates.
As with proper operation and maintenance of your vehicle, Rivian is not responsible for you receiving and
maintaining your vehicle’s maintenance and service records. Detailed records must include the service center
location or mobile service identification number, service dates, description of services, and the full 17-digit
vehicle identification number (VIN). Transferring any maintenance or service records should the vehicle be
resold is not Rivian's responsibility.
The following events may also void the New Vehicle Limited Warranty:
l
Abuse or neglect that interferes with the proper functioning of the vehicle.
l VIN defacing or alterations.
l Odometer modifications or disconnections.
l Vehicles that have been determined to be dismantled, fire damaged, flooded, salvaged, or a total loss.
l
Damage to your vehicle due to towing that was not pre-authorized by Rivian Customer Service or Roadside
Assistance.
Rivian also reserves the right to use telemetry data obtained directly or remotely, or any other vehicle-related
data gathered by any means, to verify any vehicle or vehicle system fault, troubleshoot any concern, conduct
research and analysis for vehicle improvement, evaluate vehicle functionality and performance, analyze vehicle
incidents, and approve or deny warranty claims.
If your vehicle leaves the United States, for warranty purposes:
l
Except where specifically required by law, there is no warranty coverage for this vehicle if it is outside of the
50 United States, Washington D.C., or Canada.
l
This policy does not apply to vehicles registered to U.S. government officials or military personnel on
assignment outside of the 50 United States and Washington D.C.
Except as described below, taking your product to be serviced by a repair shop that is not a Rivian authorized
repair facility will not void this warranty, and using third-party parts alone will not void this warranty. However,
Rivian will exclude warranty coverage for defects or damage caused by unauthorized parts, service, or use of
the vehicle (including defects or damage caused by use of aftermarket parts or use of the vehicle for racing or
competition). The denial of coverage may be based on the installation of parts designed for unauthorized uses
of the vehicle. Rivian strongly recommends that you have all maintenance, service, and repairs done at a
Rivian-authorized repair facility.

New Vehicle Limited Warranty
Damages
Rivian is not responsible for any indirect damages arising out of, or relating to, Rivian vehicles or products,
including, but not limited to, transportation to and from a Rivian-authorized repair facility, loss of access to the
vehicle, and any damages resulting from loss of vehicle access.
Rivian shall not be liable for any direct damages in an amount that exceeds the purchase price paid for the
vehicle or product. The above limitations and exclusions shall apply whether your claim is in contract, tort
(including negligence and gross negligence), breach of warranty or condition, misrepresentation (whether
negligent or otherwise) or otherwise at law or in equity, even if Rivian is advised of the possibility of such
damages or such damages are reasonably foreseeable. Rivian is not responsible for any fees or costs incurred
in connection with litigating any such claim.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of indirect, direct, incidental, special, or
consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

Warranty only applies to XPEL's Products which are professionally installed by an authorized XPEL installer.

materials or workmanship for 24 months commencing on the date of sale or installation by an authorized

made solely by Rivian.
The part replaced under the terms of this warranty shall become the property of Rivian.

Other Limited Warranties
Limitations for Service Parts Sold over the Counter
When a part that is sold over the counter is already removed from the vehicle and returned to the authorized
service center as defective with the original sales receipt, if Rivian finds a defect in materials or workmanship,
Rivian will cover either:
l The cost of repairing the part, or
l The cost of an equivalent new or remanufactured replacement Original Part.
The labor required to remove and reinstall the part, in this situation, is not reimbursable to the customer.
For consumer-installed parts, the warranty start date is the invoice date of the parts sale. The original invoice to
prove the parts warranty start date must be provided in the event of a subsequent failure.
Original parts that are replaced under the Service Parts Limited Warranty receive the remainder of the original
24-month coverage, should subsequent failures occur.
Adventure Gear Limited Warranty
Rivian Adventure Gear purchased with your Rivian vehicle or purchased separately from your vehicle has a
2-year warranty from the date of delivery with proof of purchase.
For further details, exceptions to warranty periods, and exclusions and limitations, see the Adventure Gear

Exchange Parts
Warranty repairs may be resolved by using exchanged parts with the intent to reduce the amount of time you
are without your vehicle. New, reconditioned, remanufactured, or repaired parts may be used in this exchange
service. In any case, all exchanged parts will have the same limited warranty as service parts and meet Rivian
standards. The decision whether to repair, replace, or provide remanufactured parts, along with the condition
of the replacement parts, is reserved for Rivian at the sole discretion of Rivian.
Production Changes
Rivian may make changes to new vehicle design and update warranty coverage for new vehicles at any time.
Production changes or upgrades to new vehicles do not obligate Rivian to update vehicles already built with
component parts of a different type or design, so long as the vehicle functions properly with the repair,
adjustment, or installation of replacement parts under the warranty.
This Warranty Guide will be updated with a new effective date, shown on the title page, if any warranty terms
have changed. The new warranty terms will only apply to vehicles sold after that date.
Nothing in this warranty should be construed as requiring defective parts to be replaced with parts of a
different type or design than the original part, so long as the vehicle functions properly with the replacement
part.
Modifications and Waivers
Only an authorized Rivian representative can modify this R1T + R1S New Vehicle Limited Warranty Guide (the
"Warranty Guide"). Rivian may cover more service and repair costs than are necessary as detailed in the
Warranty Guide. In some cases, Rivian choosing to offer to pay for services and repairs beyond the limited
warranty are known as “adjustment programs.” In the event Rivian initiates an adjustment program, Rivian will
attempt to contact owners of registered affected vehicles. Owners may contact Rivian to determine if their
vehicle is covered in a broader adjustment program. The choice to use adjustment programs does not affect
Rivian’s right to pay for repair and services beyond warranty requirements on a case-by-case basis.
Rivian reserves the right to perform additional services, make changes to Rivian vehicles, and pay for service
and repairs beyond those covered in the Warranty Guide without incurring any obligation on Rivian to perform
similar actions on other vehicles. This Warranty Guide does not imply any Rivian vehicle is expected to contain
defects or is completely free from defects. Defects may be unintentionally introduced into vehicles during the
design and manufacturing processes. Such defects could result in the need for repairs. For this reason, Rivian
provides the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to remedy any such manufacturing defects that result in vehicle
component part malfunction or failure during the warranty period.
