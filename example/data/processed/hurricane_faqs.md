Hurricanes: Interesting Facts and F.A.Q.

  The word hurricane comes from the Taino Native American word, hurucane, meaning

evil spirit of the wind.

  The first time anyone flew into a hurricane happened in 1943 in the middle of World

War II.

  A tropical storm is classified as a hurricane once winds goes up to 74 miles per hour or

higher.

  Hurricanes are the only weather disasters that have been given their own names.

  All hurricanes begin life in a warm moist atmosphere over tropical ocean waters.

  A typical hurricane can dump 6 inches to a foot of rain across a region.

  The most violent winds and heaviest rains take place in the eye wall, the ring of clouds

and thunderstorms closely surrounding the eye.

  Every second, a large hurricane releases the energy of 10 atomic bombs.

  Hurricanes can also produce tornadoes. They are not as strong as regular tornadoes and

last only a few minutes.

  Slow moving hurricanes produce more rainfall and can cause more damage from

flooding than faster-moving, more powerful hurricanes.

  Hurricane Floyd was barely a category I hurricane, but it still managed to mow down 19

million trees and caused over a billion dollars in damage.

  Most people who die in hurricanes are killed by the towering walls of sea water that

comes inland.



In the Pacific Ocean, Hurricanes are generally known as typhoons. In the Indian Ocean
they are called tropical cyclones.

  The man who first gave names to hurricanes was an Australian weather forecaster

named C. Wragge in the early 1900s.

  The first hurricane of the year is given a name beginning with the letter “A”.

  Hurricane season is from June to November when the seas are at their warmest and

most humid, which are ripe conditions for a hurricane to develop.

  The planet Jupiter has a hurricane which has been going on for over 300 years. It can be
seen as a red spot on the planet. This hurricane on Jupiter is bigger than the Earth itself.

Q. What are “Cape Verde” type hurricanes?

Cape Verde-type hurricanes are those Atlantic basin tropical cyclones that develop into tropical
storms fairly close (<1000km or so) to the Cape Verde Islands and then become hurricanes
before reaching the Caribbean. (there may be other definitions). Typically, this occurs in August
and September, but in rare years (like 1995), there may be some in late July and/or early
October. The numbers range from none up to around five per year, with an average of around
2.

Q. What is the “eye?” How is it formed and maintained?
The “eye”(cid:157) is a roughly circular area of comparatively light winds and fair weather found at the
center of a severe tropical cyclone. Although the winds are calm at the axis of rotation, strong
winds may extend well into the eye. There is little or no precipitation in the eye, and sometimes
blue sky or stars can be seen. The eye is the region of lowest surface pressure and warmest
temperatures aloft: the eye temperature may be more than 10°C (18°F) warmer at an altitude
of 12 km (8 mi) than the surrounding environment, but only 0-2°C (0-3°F) warmer at the surface
in the tropical cyclone. Eyes range in size from 8 km (5 mi) to over 200 km (120 mi) across, but
most are approximately 30–60 km (20–40 mi) in diameter. The eye is surrounded by the
eyewall—”the roughly circular area of deep convection which is the area of highest surface
winds in the tropical cyclone. The eye is composed of air that is slowly sinking and the eyewall
has a net upward flow as a result of many moderate and occasionally strong updrafts and
downdrafts. The eye’s warm temperatures are due to compressional warming of the subsiding
air. Most soundings taken within the eye show a low-level layer which is relatively moist, with
an inversion above. This suggests that the sinking in the eye typically does not reach the ocean
surface, but instead only gets to around 1–3 km of the surface.

The general mechanisms by which the eye and eyewall are formed are not fully understood,
although observations have shed some light on the subject. The calm eye of the tropical
cyclone shares many qualitative characteristics with other vortical systems such as tornadoes,
waterspouts, dust devils and whirlpools. Given that many of these lack a change of phase of
water (i.e. no clouds and diabatic heating involved), it may be that the eye feature is a
fundamental component to all rotating fluids. It has been hypothesized that supergradient wind
flow (i.e. swirling winds that are stronger than what the local pressure gradient can typically
support) near the radius of maximum winds (RMW) causes air to be centrifuged out of the eye
into the eyewall, thus accounting for the subsidence in the eye. However, Willoughby found
that the swirling winds within several tropical storms and hurricanes were within 1–4% of
gradient balance. It may be that the amount of supergradient flow needed to cause such
centrifuging of air is only on the order of a couple percent and thus difficult to measure.

Another feature of tropical cyclones that probably plays a role in forming and maintaining the
eye is the eyewall convection. Convection in tropical cyclones is organized into long, narrow
rainbands which are oriented in the same direction as the horizontal wind. Because these
bands seem to spiral into the center of a tropical cyclone, they are sometimes called spiral
bands. Along these bands, low-level convergence is at a maximum, and therefore, upper-level
divergence is most pronounced above. A direct circulation develops in which warm, moist air
converges at the surface, ascends through these bands, diverges aloft, and descends on both
sides of the bands. Subsidence is distributed over a wide area on the outside of the rainband
but is concentrated in the small inside area. As the air subsides, adiabatic warming takes place,
and the air dries. Because subsidence is concentrated on the inside of the band, the adiabatic

warming is stronger inward from the band causing a sharp fall in pressure across the band since
warm air is lighter than cold air. Because of the pressure drops on the inside, the tangential
winds around the tropical cyclone increase due to the increases in the pressure gradient.
Eventually, the band moves toward the center and encircles it and the eye and eyewall form.

Thus, the cloud-free eye may be due to a combination of dynamically forced centrifuging of
mass out of the eye into the eyewall and to a forced descent caused by the moist convection of
the eyewall. This topic is certainly one that can use more research to ascertain which
mechanism is primary.

Some of the most intense tropical cyclones exhibit concentric eyewalls—two or more eyewall
structures centered at the circulation center of the storm. Just as the inner eyewall forms,
convection surrounding the eyewall can become organized into distinct rings. Eventually, the
inner eye begins to feel the effects of the subsidence resulting from the outer eyewall, and the
inner eyewall weakens to be replaced by the outer eyewall. The increasing pressure due to the
destruction of the inner eyewall is usually more rapid than the decreasing pressure caused by
the intensification of the outer eyewall, causing the cyclone to weaken for a short period of
time.

Q. What does an average hurricane season mean?
An average hurricane season brings 10.6 tropical storms. Six of those become hurricanes and
two become major hurricanes, meaning category 3 or greater.

The average is based on data from 1968 to 2003. Officially, the Atlantic hurricane season is
from June 1 to November 30, although storms can form outside this time period.

Q. What year was the most active? What year was the least active?
Until recently, 1933 had the most named storms on record with 21. In 2005, that record was
broken when the National Hurricane Center identified 28 storms. Since all of the traditional
names had been used for 2005, the last six named storms were called "Alpha," "Beta,"
"Gamma," "Delta," "Epsilon," and "Zeta," the first six letters of the Greek alphabet.

1933 is now second, and 1995 is third with 19 tropical storms. 2005 also had the most
hurricanes in one season with 15. The least number of tropical storms happened in 1983 when
just four storms formed. In 1982, just two hurricanes formed, making it the year with the least
amount of hurricanes since 1968.

Q. Do I need to open my windows when a hurricane approaches?
That's a question we get every hurricane season. The answer is a resounding no. It is a myth
that opening windows will help equalize pressure in your house when a hurricane approaches.

Your windows should be boarded up with plywood or shutters. Leaving your windows open will
just bring a lot of rain into your house and flying debris could fly into your home, too. Don't
waste time taping your windows either. It won't help prevent hurricane damage. It's just
another myth.

Q. Why are hurricanes named?

A tropical cyclone is given a name when it becomes a tropical storm. It's much easier to
remember the name of a storm than try to track it by using latitude and longitude. It also helps
prevent confusion when there is more than one tropical storm or hurricane occurring at the
same time.

In 1953, the U.S. Weather Bureau began assigning women's names to tropical storms. In 1979,
men's names were included on the list. The names are in alphabetical order, excluding the
letters Q, U, X, Y and Z.

Today, the list includes names of English, Spanish and French origin because these languages
are most commonly used by the countries in the Atlantic Basin. There are six lists of names.
Each list is used in rotation every six years.

Q. How and why are names retired?
A name is retired when the storm caused so many deaths or so much destruction that it would
be confusing or insensitive to use the name again. The World Meteorological Organization is in
charge of retiring hurricane names and choosing new names.

The headline-making hurricanes of 2004 -- Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne -- have all been
retired. They will be replaced by Colin, Fiona, Igor, and Julia when the list is used again this
year.

Q. Does El Niño affect hurricanes?
It can. In years with an El Niño, there are typically fewer tropical storms and hurricanes because
vertical shear increases during El Niño years. The vertical shear can prevent tropical cyclones
from forming and can prevent storms from intensifying.

El Niño is a warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters, which usually occurs every three to
seven years and affects weather patterns around the world.

La Niña is the opposite of El Niño and is characterized by cooler than normal ocean waters in
the tropical Pacific. In years with La Niña, researchers have found that there is an increased
number of hurricanes and an increased chance that the United States and Caribbean will
experience hurricanes.
