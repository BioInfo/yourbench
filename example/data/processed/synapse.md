# 2. THE STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE & PROBLEM STATEMENT

## Industry Inflection Point

The biopharmaceutical industry stands at a unique technological inflection point. Recent breakthroughs in foundation models and Agentic AI now make it possible to transform historically siloed data assets into powerful insights generations, prediction and decision-making engines. Companies that rapidly leverage these technologies will establish significant competitive advantages, while those that delay risk falling behind in the increasingly data-driven landscape of drug development.

## The Unsustainable Status Quo

The current oncology drug development paradigm is fundamentally unsustainable. Despite decades of process improvements, we face persistent challenges that threaten our ability to deliver innovative therapies efficiently:

**1. High Attrition, Especially at Phase 2-3:** Despite advances in drug discovery, predicting Phase 3 success from Phase 2 data remains challenging. Suboptimal patient stratification, late-stage biomarker failures, and unexpected toxicity/efficacy profiles frequently lead to costly late-stage failures. Each failure represents not only billions in sunk costs but also delays in bringing potentially life-saving therapies to patients.

**2. Data Overload & Insight Scarcity:** We generate vast, multi-modal data (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, imaging, clinical, preclinical, real-world data), but extracting timely, actionable insights across these silos is a major bottleneck. This is particularly acute in biomarker discovery and translational medicine, where connecting preclinical signals to clinical outcomes is paramount. Our scientists often have access to the data needed to make breakthrough discoveries, but lack the tools to uncover non-obvious patterns and relationships.

**3. Inefficient Knowledge Work:** Critical tasks like comprehensive literature reviews, cross-trial analysis, safety signal detection, and protocol optimization are often manual, slow, and resource-intensive, delaying key decisions. Our highly skilled scientific and clinical teams spend disproportionate time on these labor-intensive activities rather than on higher-value strategic thinking and innovation.

## Strategic Opportunity

These challenges coincide with unprecedented advancements in AI capabilities. Foundation models now demonstrate remarkable ability to understand complex biomedical concepts across multiple data modalities. Agentic AI systems can autonomously perform complex workflows requiring reasoning, decision-making, and adaptation—exactly the capabilities needed to address our most pressing R&D bottlenecks.

We possess three crucial assets that position us to capitalize on this opportunity:

1. **Rich Proprietary Data:** Decades of oncology research have generated a wealth of proprietary data across preclinical models, clinical trials, and translational studies—data that remains largely untapped for AI-driven insights.
2. **Domain Expertise:** Our scientific and clinical teams possess deep oncology knowledge that can guide AI system development and ensure outputs are biologically meaningful and clinically relevant.
3. **Technical Foundation:** Our existing data science team provides the core technical capabilities needed to rapidly build and deploy these advanced AI systems.
