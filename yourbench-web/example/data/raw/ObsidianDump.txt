Ask Ronen about forwarding info about courses, seminar, hackathons, news, etc to ODSP people

To discuss in our culture meeting: Should we be the ones redirecting (internal) courses/seminars/hackathons/news/innovative initiatives through Teams/emails to ODS/ODSP? Because I feel that many of these get lost in Workplace posts, or even external news of i.e. new models, tech, etc. that people might be interested in/inspired by... (i.e. [https://astrazeneca.workplace.com/groups/2195934850494359/permalink/8010649715689481/](https://astrazeneca.workplace.com/groups/2195934850494359/permalink/8010649715689481/ "https://astrazeneca.workplace.com/groups/2195934850494359/permalink/8010649715689481/"))  I spoke with Kim, a while ago about some kind of research/innovation newsletter, and she proposed to add it to the bi-weekly update. However, I am not sure if that should be the channel. Let's also discuss this role when you are back.

Try to speak again with Kim about this:

### Executive Summary

(AI)Xcelerate is a **culture and community** initiative focused on **building AI literacy, fostering collaboration**, and **championing organizational change**.
