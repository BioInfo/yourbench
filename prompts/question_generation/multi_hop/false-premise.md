# Multi-Document False Premise Question Generation

You will receive multiple document extracts from the same source document and a summary. Your task is to generate high-quality false premise questions that present incorrect assumptions or assertions that contradict information across the provided text extracts, requiring multi-hop reasoning.

## Core Principles

1. **Cross-Text Contradiction**
   - False premises must contradict multiple text chunks
   - Correction must be supported by multiple chunks
   - No external knowledge required
   - Clear evidence for correction from multiple sources

2. **Question Diversity**
   - Multi-hop factual contradictions
   - Cross-chunk process inversions
   - Inter-chunk relationship errors
   - Complex temporal mistakes
   - Multi-step causal errors
   - Cross-reference definition mistakes

3. **Question Quality**
   - Clear false premise spanning multiple chunks
   - Obvious text contradictions across chunks
   - Evidence-based correction from multiple sources
   - Meaningful error requiring multi-hop reasoning

## Question Generation Process

1. **Cross-Chunk Contradiction Identification**
   - Identify key facts across chunks
   - Note relationships between chunks
   - Map processes spanning chunks
   - Understand system interactions

2. **Multi-Hop Premise Inversion**
   - Create clear contradictions requiring multiple chunks
   - Ensure text evidence from multiple sources
   - Make errors identifiable through cross-reference
   - Plan corrections requiring synthesis

3. **Complex Question Formation**
   - Present false premise spanning chunks
   - Request correction using multiple sources
   - Enable multi-hop evidence use
   - Support comprehensive explanation

4. **Multi-Source Quality Verification**
   - Check contradiction clarity across chunks
   - Verify text evidence from multiple sources
   - Confirm correction path through chunks
   - Test usefulness of multi-hop reasoning

## Examples

### Example 1: Cross-Chunk Fact Contradiction (Medium)

```json
{
    "document_extract_analysis": "The text discusses climate change impacts across different regions and time periods.",
    "chunk_analyses": [
        {
            "chunk_id": "chunk1",
            "content_summary": "Arctic temperature changes from 1980-2000",
            "relevant_information": "2Â°C increase in Arctic temperatures",
            "connection_points": ["temperature trends", "timeline connection"]
        },
        {
            "chunk_id": "chunk2",
            "content_summary": "Arctic temperature changes from 2000-2020",
            "relevant_information": "Additional 3Â°C increase",
            "connection_points": ["temperature trends", "cumulative effects"]
        }
    ],

    "potential_question_directions": [
        "How do the temperature changes compare across periods?",

        "How do the chunks show progression of change?"
    ],

    "comprehension_type": "fact_contradiction",
    "quality_metrics": {
        "clear_language": true,
        "text_based": true,
        "no_tricks": true
    },
    "supporting_quotes": [
        "2Â°C increase in Arctic temperatures from 1980-2000",
        "Additional 3Â°C increase from 2000-2020"
    ],
    "quote_context": "The quotes establish a total 5Â°C increase across both periods.",
    "kind": "false-premise",
    "question": "The text indicates that Arctic temperatures increased by only 1Â°C total from 1980-2020. What's wrong with this premise and what do the texts actually say?",
    "answer": "The texts show a total increase of 5Â°C: 2Â°C from 1980-2000 and an additional 3Â°C from 2000-2020",
    "reasoning": "Requires combining information from both chunks to determine total change.",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "difficulty_justification": "Requires synthesizing numerical information across multiple chunks."
}
```

### Example 2: Multi-Hop Process Inversion (Hard)

```json
{
    "document_extract_analysis": "The text explains photosynthesis and cellular respiration processes.",
    "chunk_analyses": [
        {
            "chunk_id": "chunk1",
            "content_summary": "Photosynthesis process and inputs",

    },

        "Plants use sunlight to convert CO2 and water into glucose",
        "Glucose broken down to release energy"
    ],
    "quote_context": "The quotes establish the correct sequence of glucose production then consumption.",
    "kind": "false-premise",
    "question": "The text suggests that cellular respiration produces glucose which is then used in photosynthesis to create energy. What's wrong with this premise and what is the actual sequence described?",
    "answer": "The texts describe the opposite sequence: photosynthesis produces glucose first, which is then broken down during cellular respiration to release energy",
    "reasoning": "Requires understanding the relationship between processes described in separate chunks.",
    "difficulty": 4,
    "difficulty_justification": "Requires synthesizing process information across chunks and understanding causal relationships."
}
```

### Example 3: Cross-Chunk System Contradiction (Very Hard)

```json
{
    "document_extract_analysis": "The text explains ecosystem relationships in a coral reef.",
    "chunk_analyses": [
        {
            "chunk_id": "chunk1",
            "content_summary": "Coral-algae symbiosis",
            "relevant_information": "Corals provide shelter, algae provide nutrients",
            "connection_points": ["symbiotic relationships", "nutrient cycling"]
        },
        {
            "chunk_id": "chunk2",
            "content_summary": "Reef fish interactions",
            "relevant_information": "Fish clean corals and control algae growth",
            "connection_points": ["ecosystem balance", "species interactions"]
        },
        {
            "chunk_id": "chunk3",
            "content_summary": "Environmental impacts",
            "relevant_information": "Temperature affects all relationships",
            "connection_points": ["environmental factors", "system stability"]
        }
    ],
    "testable_concepts": [
        "ecosystem relationships",
        "symbiotic interactions",
        "environmental effects"
    ],
    "potential_question_directions": [
        "How do different species interact in the reef?",
        "What maintains ecosystem balance?",
        "How do environmental factors affect relationships?"
    ],
    "best_direction": "How do different species interact in the reef?",
    "comprehension_type": "system_contradiction",
    "quality_metrics": {
        "clear_language": true,
        "text_based": true,
        "no_tricks": true
    },
    "supporting_quotes": [
        "Corals provide shelter, algae provide nutrients",
        "Fish clean corals and control algae growth",
        "Temperature affects all relationships"
    ],
    "quote_context": "The quotes establish complex interdependencies between species.",
    "kind": "false-premise",
    "question": "The text suggests that coral reef species operate independently, with corals harming algae, fish avoiding corals, and temperature having no effect on these relationships. What's wrong with these premises and how does the system actually work according to the texts?",
    "answer": "The texts describe a highly interdependent system where corals and algae have a mutually beneficial relationship, fish actively help maintain coral health, and temperature affects all these relationships",
    "reasoning": "Requires synthesizing information about multiple relationships across all three chunks.",
    "difficulty": 5,
    "difficulty_justification": "Requires understanding complex system interactions described across multiple chunks and identifying multiple contradictions."
}
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Single-Chunk Focus**
   â "Contradiction only references one chunk"
   â "Contradiction spans multiple chunks requiring synthesis"

2. **Shallow Connections**
   â "Simple fact checking across chunks"
   â "Deep relationship understanding across chunks"

3. **Isolated Analysis**
   â "Treating chunks independently"
   â "Integrating information across chunks"

4. **Missing Connections**
   â "Failing to link related information"
   â "Explicitly connecting cross-chunk concepts"

## Output Requirements

1. Generate 3-5 multi-hop false premise questions
2. Include questions requiring at least 2 chunks
3. Ensure clear contradictions across chunks
4. Include explicit corrections using multiple sources
5. All premises must be clearly false
6. Questions should test cross-chunk understanding

## Example Output Format

Enclose your output in <generated_questions> tags:

```json
<generated_questions>
[
    {
        // Question 1 (Medium/Cross-Chunk Fact)
    },
    {
        // Question 2 (Hard/Multi-Hop Process)
    },
    {
        // Question 3 (Very Hard/System)
    },
    // ...
]
</generated_questions>
```
